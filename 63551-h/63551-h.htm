<h2 class="nobreak">TO THE READER</h2>

</div>

<p>The correspondence from which the letters
in this book have been selected passed (with
the exception of the last) during 1919. The last
is a little later.</p>

<p>Mr. Richard Haven, some of whose letters are
to be found in a preceding volume, <i>The Vermilion
Box</i>, is still a bachelor and still lives in Mills
Buildings, Knightsbridge, but is doubtful if he
can afford it much longer.</p>

<p>Miss Verena Raby, the centre of this epistolary
circle, is one of Mr. Haven’s oldest friends. Old
Place, the ancestral home over which she now
reigns, is near Kington in Herefordshire, on the
borders of England and the Principality which
provides us impartially with perplexities and
saviours. Miss Raby is one of a family of nine,
but none of the others neglect any opportunity of
postponing letter-writing. Of these brothers and
sisters, all save one—Lucilla, Nesta’s mother—are
living, or were living when these pages went to
press.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_viii"></a>[viii]</span></p>

<p>Nesta Rossiter, who is managing Old Place
during Miss Raby’s illness, married Fred Rossiter,
an amateur painter, and they have three children,
Antoinette (or “Tony”), Lobbie and Cyril.</p>

<p>Emily Goodyer is the children’s nurse. She is
also the fiancée of Bert Urible, greengrocer, soldier
and then greengrocer again.</p>

<p>Theodore Raby is Verena’s brother and a
widower with one daughter, Josey.</p>

<p>Walter Raby, another brother, is ranching in
Texas.</p>

<p>Hazel Barrance, daughter of Clara Raby, is
another of Miss Raby’s nieces. She was a V.A.D.
during the War, but has now returned to Kensington
routine, in a not too congenial home. Her
brother Roy also finds Peace heavy on his hands
but has more chances for liberty and diversion,
and grasps most of them.</p>

<p>Evangeline Barrance, a sister still at school, is
one of the youngest editors in Europe.</p>

<p>Mr. Horace Mun-Brown, Miss Raby’s nephew
and a briefless barrister, lives in the Temple on
a small income and a sanguine disposition.</p>

<p>Mr. Septimus Tribe, the husband of Verena’s
youngest sister, Letitia, and by some years her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_ix"></a>[ix]</span>
senior, was at the Board of Trade, but is now in
retirement at Tunbridge Wells.</p>

<p>Clemency Power is an Irish girl who managed
to get out to France during the War, although
under age, and was so happy and busy there that
she abandoned idleness permanently. Her mother,
a widow, the daughter of an Irish peer, lives with
Clemency’s two younger sisters near Kenmare.
Patricia, aged nineteen, is the only one who comes
into this correspondence.</p>

<p>Miss Louisa Parrish, who was at school with
Verena and looks upon that accident as an indissoluble
bond, lives frugally but with no loss of
social position in her late father’s house in a
Berkshire village.</p>

<p>Nicholas Devose is a traveller and artist who
came nearer marrying Verena Raby than any
other man has done.</p>

<p>Bryan Field is a young doctor whose path
crossed that of Clemency Power in France during
the War.</p>

<p>Sir Smithfield Mark is one of the leading surgeons
at Bart’s.</p>

<p>Sinclair Ferguson is Miss Raby’s doctor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_x"></a>[x]</span></p>

<p>Lady Sandys is a neighbour of the Rossiters in
Kent.</p>

<p>Vincent Frank is remaining in the R.A.F.
although the War is over.</p>

<p>Mrs. Carlyon, whom we meet at once, only to
lose her again, is a neighbour of Miss Raby at
Kington.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Haven</span>,—I am sorry to have rather
bad news for you. My neighbour, Miss Raby, has
had the misfortune to fall and hurt her spine, and
Mr. Ferguson, our doctor, is afraid that she may
have to lie up for some long time. She is not in
much pain, but must be very quiet. She was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
anxious that you should be told. It was fortunate
that I was at home when the accident happened,
as her maids are not good in emergencies. Mr.
Ferguson, who is exceptionally capable for a
country place, will call in a specialist, but I fear
there is no doubt about the seriousness of the
injury and that her recovery will be a long business.
Miss Raby is very brave and even smiling
over it, but for anyone so active and so much interested
in the life around her it will be a trial.
She is hoping for one of her nieces, Mrs. Rossiter,
to come directly.—I am, yours sincerely,</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Dearest Verena</span>, your letter—or rather Mrs.
Carlyon’s, containing your bad news—gave me
a shock. Do you really mean to say you will
have to lie up for months—flat and helpless?
This is terrible for you—and for us. Of course I
shall come and see you as soon as may be; but it
can’t be yet. Why do you live so far away? And
I will write, but if you cannot use your hands you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
must get either Mrs. Carlyon or Nesta (if she is
there) to answer a number of questions at once.
(I am glad Nesta is coming.)</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="hanging">(a) Can you use your hands?</p>

<p class="hanging">(b) Does it tire you too much to read?</p>

<p class="hanging">(c) Have you much or any pain?</p>

<p class="hanging">(d) What can I do for you first?</p>

<p class="hanging">(e) Have you a library subscription?</p>

<p class="hanging">(f) Is there anyone in the neighbourhood who
can read aloud, endurably?</p>

<p class="hanging">(g) (Don’t worry: you are not to have the
whole alphabet.) Do games of solitaire
appeal to you?</p>

</div>

<p>I want you to think of me as your Universal
Provider and to express your needs without any
reserve. For what else am I useful? Consider
me, in short, as a Callisthenes whose motto is
“Deeds not Words.”—Yours,</p>

<p class="right">R. H.</p>

<p><i>P.S.</i>—(h) Have you a gramophone? And if
not, does the idea of a gramophone
repel or attract?</p>

<p><i>P.S. 2.</i>—<span class="smcap">Dearest Verena</span>, I hate it that
you should be ill—you who live normally a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
hundred minutes to the hour. But if there is no
heritage of weakness you will be all the better for
the enforced rest. That I intend to think and

</div>

<p>We regret to state that Miss Verena Raby of
Old Place, Kington, who is so well known as the
Lady Bountiful of the neighbourhood, has met
with a serious accident through falling on the ice
and sustained spinal injuries which may confine
her to her room for several months. Every one
will wish her a speedy recovery.</p>

<hr />

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="V">V<br />
<span class="smcap">Nesta Rossiter to Richard Haven</span></h2>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear “Uncle” Richard</span>,—I got here this
afternoon and found Aunt Verena very still and
white and pathetic, but the doctor is cheerful and
a London swell, a friend of his—Sir Smithfield
Mark—is expected to-morrow. Mrs. Carlyon,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
who lives in that big house near the church, on
the Llandrindod road, has been kindness itself.
I have come prepared to stay for a considerable
time. Fred has promised not to go away just
yet and fortunately we have a very good nurse.
A little later perhaps Lobbie, my second, will
come to me here; it depends on how quiet Aunt
Verena has to be kept.</p>

<p>Now for the answers to your questions, which
Mrs. Carlyon has handed over to me:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="hanging">(a) She can use her hands but is not permitted
to do anything tiring, such as
writing.</p>

<p class="hanging">(b) She has to lie too flat to be able to hold
a book with any comfort for more than
a very short while.</p>

<p class="hanging">(c) She is not in serious pain.</p>

<p class="hanging">(d) What she most wants is letters from
her friends, and you, I imagine, in particular.</p>

<p class="hanging">(e) She has a library subscription, but would
like to know what books are cheerful.
She does not want to lie awake thinking
about other people’s frustrated lives.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
She is rather tired of novels with the
Café Royal in them.</p>

<p class="hanging">(f) I have done my best for years to learn
to read aloud, for the sake of the children,
but most of the sentences end in
a yawn. I wonder why it makes one so
sleepy.</p>

<p class="hanging">(g) This is really most important. Aunt
Verena is devoted to Solitaire and thinks
that a little later it might help her.
But in her horizontal position it is, of
course, impossible to use a table. What
we have been wondering is whether it
would be possible to get an arrangement
by which it could be played on a
more or less vertical board. Do you
think this could be managed? I have
been thinking about it and can suggest
only long spikes and holes in the
cards so that they could be hung on.
Do you know anyone who could carry
out such a scheme? She is going along
very satisfactorily and is a perfect patient.
She tells me to give you her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
love and thank you for all your suggestions.—Yours
sincerely,</p>

<span class="smcap">Hazel Barrance to Verena Raby</span></h2>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Dearest Aunt Verena</span>,—We are so sorry to
hear about your accident, and so glad that some
of the reports were exaggerated. Father says
that nothing would give him such joy as to go to
bed for a year, and then perhaps he might lose a
few of his seventeen permanent colds; but he
sends his love too. There is no news; the chief
is that Roy has been demobbed and is wondering
what his future is to be. His present is
largely Jazz and avoiding father. The lucky
boy is staying with some rich friends in Kensington.
I am glad that Nesta is with you. Mother
has given up Christian Science in favour of what
father calls Unchristian Séance.</p>

<p>It’s an awful thing to say, but I often regret
the loss of the War. Not because I was a profiteer,
but because I then had something to do and
some fun with it. But now?—Your loving</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Hazel</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="VII">VII<br />
<span class="smcap">Richard Haven to Verena Raby</span></h2>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">My Dear</span>, of course I will write. If I were
not tied to London just now by office work I
should take rooms near you and do my best to
spoil you. But that cannot be. Instead I will
send you a letter as often as possible. In fact, I
wouldn’t mind, if it would really give you any
satisfaction, promising to write every day. <i>Nulla
dies sine epistola</i>—however short. Shall I? I
never made such an undertaking before in my
life.</p>

<p>As to books—when I am ill I am like the man
who when a new one came out read an old one—Dr.
Johnson or Hazlitt or Mr. Birrell—and
therefore I am a bad counsellor. Were I to have
a nice luxurious little illness at this moment I
should take with me to the nursing home <i>Emma</i>
and <i>Mansfield Park</i>; but they are men’s books
far more than women’s. I should also put into
practice a project I have long had in mind—the
attempted re-reading of certain favourites of my
schooldays, to see if they will stand the test.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
Probably not. These include <i>Midshipman Easy</i>,
<i>Zanoni</i>, <i>Kenelm Chillingly</i> and, above all, <i>Moby
Dick</i>; but I doubt if any of these are in Miss
Raby’s line. Nor is, I am afraid, my glorious
new friend, O. Henry. In default of a better I
send by parcel post the old 6-volume edition of
Fanny Burney’s <i>Diary</i>.</p>

<p>Picture me hunting about for a Reader. Surely
among all the demobilised young women who are
said to be pining for a job I can find one! Don’t
be frightened—she shall not be too startlingly
from one of the great tea-drinking departments of
the Government—but I can’t guarantee that her
skirts will be below her knees. There are no long
skirts left in London to-day, and no stockings
that are not silk. I am not an observant person,
but I have noticed that; I have noticed also that
the silk does not always go the whole way. But
perhaps among all your vast array of relations
you know of a nice girl. If so, say so and I will
not pursue the chase, but at the moment more
than one agency is being busy about it. “Must
have a pleasant voice and be able to keep it up
for an hour without one gape”—that is what I
tell them.</p>

<p>I must now stop or your poor arms will be tired
with holding this up. Don’t forget that I want
to know what Sir Smithfield Mark says. Apropos
of doctors, I met old Beamish at the club to-day,
very cock-a-hoop as he was just off to North
Berwick, on his doctor’s advice, and without Mrs.
B. He said with a wink that every man should
have three doctors, carefully selected, to consult
with discretion: one, when things were slackening
domestically, to assure his wife that he must
be fed up—better and more nourishing food,
oysters and so forth; one when he was bored
with town, to assure his wife that he is badly
in need of a change and ought to go off on a little
holiday at once, alone; and one to look after him
when he is really ill.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Mrs. Carlyon</span>, we are all very grateful

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sister</span>,—We are gravely disturbed by
the news of your accident and trust that recovery
will be swift and sure, although injury to the
spine is often slow in healing and not infrequently
leaves permanent weakness. You are, however,
normally strong, much stronger than my poor

every day. Strange that two sisters should be so
different.</p>

<p>I shall be glad to be informed if there is anything
that I can do to alleviate your mind at this
season. Since we have had no details of your
illness nor are acquainted with your medical man,
it is possible that I may be suggesting a gravity
which the case does not possess; but from what I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
know of spinal troubles, I think that if you have
not yet considered the drawing-up of your will
you ought to do so. Most probably you have,
for you have always been thoughtful, but even
the most complete will is liable to second and
third thoughts, which necessitate codicils. It
occurs to me that the presence of a man of affairs,
such as myself, might be of use to you while you
perform this delicate task, and it is, of course,
more suitable for one who is allied to you through
kin to stand beside your bed than for a stranger.
I have stood beside too many for you to feel any
embarrassment. I have also acted as Executor
and Trustee on several occasions; in fact, few men
can have had more experience than I in giving
counsel as to wise benefactions.</p>

you been my honorary niece for years and years,
and we have hardly exchanged a word, and now,
all owing to a piece of slippery ice, I am reeling
out correspondence. But how wrong that it
should have needed such a lamentable form of
provocation!</p>

<p>You must think of me now as in constant consultation
with card-sharpers and carpenters, with
a view to solving the great Solitaire-board problem.
If it comes out, thousands of invalids, and
a few lazy folk into the bargain, will bless the
names of Raby and Rossiter, not altogether, I
hope, forgetting that of Haven; for all of us at
times have wished for the possibility of playing
card games while reclining in comfort on a sofa.
There is a thing called a card index, the maintaining
of which seems to have been the principal
task of the female war-winners in the various
Government Departments, and it is upon the
same principle (as you have already suggested)<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
that our vertical or sloping Solitaire table must
be made. Meanwhile tell me if you have one of
those invalid tables that come from Bond Street
and can be insinuated into the patient’s zone with
such ease. If not I shall send you one.</p>

<p>I ran into one of your kith and kin, Horace
Mun-Brown, to-day and told him the news, so
Verena may expect trouble. I had told him before

<span class="smcap">Hazel Barrance to Verena Raby</span></h2>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Dearest Aunt Verena</span>,—I hope you are
really better, or—if that is too much to hope yet—that
you are going on all right. As soon as
the Doctor says so, I am coming to peep at you.</p>

<p>We are living in a state of great excitement
because Mother’s old friend Mrs. Blundry is here
for a few days and she talks of nothing but
spiritualism. You know she lost her son Savile
in the War—or, to use her own word, she “gave”
him—and every night she gets out the paraphernalia
of communication and has conversations
with him. I used to think of death with terror—and
indeed I do now, of my own—but the late
Savile Blundry is transforming us all into frivolous<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
heartless creatures! From his mother’s report
of what he says, the grave has taught him
nothing, and most of his remarks are only to the
effect that it’s “jolly decent over there.”</p>

<p>Father is furious about it all and says that the
duty of the dead is to be dead: but of course he
can’t be brutal like that to Mrs. Blundry. The
fact, however, remains that she sees far more of
her Savile now than she ever did when he was
alive. Of course, if talking to the boy, or thinking
she does so, brings any comfort, one should be
glad of it—and there seem to be lots of people
getting such comfort, or groping after such comfort,
all over the world—but really, dead people
do seem to have so little to say. When it comes
to that, so do live people.</p>

<p>We have already had one real séance here,
when father was out, and wonderful results were
said to be obtained, but to my naughty sceptical
mind they weren’t of any interest whatever. After
a number of false starts and accusations of undue
control, and so forth, we got a name spelt out
which with a little lenience could be translated
into Cyrus Bowditch-Kemp by one of the women
present, who, when she was a girl, had known a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
man of that name who died in Rangoon twenty
years ago. This was, of course, frightfully
thrilling. Then he was asked if he had a message
for any member of the company and he said
“Yes” and this was the message: “Wind in the
daffodils”; and the woman nearly fainted when
she remembered that one spring afternoon when
Bowditch-Kemp was calling, there was a gale
which swayed the daffodils at the edge of the
lawn. That was all, but it was considered to be
marvellous and to prove that Mr. Bowditch-Kemp
was now the woman’s “watcher,” as they
are called.</p>

<p>I hope you are not shocked: but you said you
wanted to know all that we were doing. People
take this new spiritualism so differently; and of
course, as I said, if it is a comfort one is only too
glad, but it can be a kind of drug too, and there
is no doubt that it has made things very easy for
too many charlatans.—Your loving</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Aunt Verena</span>,—I was awfully sorry to
hear about your accident. The French mistress
has had one too, she went to London and was
knocked down by a taxi and has been in bed ever
since. We were glad about her, but I am sorry
about you. It will be horrid not to see you at
Christmas. I am going to prepare a great surprise
to cheer you while you are ill but I mustn’t
tell you any more about it now as it is a terrific
secret. Miss Arnott is reading <i>Nicholas Nickleby</i>
to us, it is very nice. I like John Browdie, don’t
you? But I think the actors are the best, Mr.
Folair and Mr. Lenville and the Infant Phenomenon.
We acted <i>The Tempest</i> the other day,
I was Ariel. It isn’t fair in a charade, is it, to
divide a word like “Shadow” into “shay” and
“dough.” It ought to be “shad” and “owe” or
“Oh!” oughtn’t it? Do answer this, because I
want to confound some of the other girls. I will

<span class="smcap">Horace Mun-Brown to Verena Raby</span></h2>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Aunt Verena</span>,—I met Haven by
chance the other morning and heard of your accident.
I am more than sorry, but I think I have
a means both of helping you to pass some of the
weary time and also, if you are so disposed, of
making good use of some of your superfluous income,
of which I have so often written to you. It
is monstrous, especially now, when the world is
trying to recover from the paralysis of the War,
that there should be any dormant bank balances,
and, except for medical attendance and nursing,
you will, I imagine, be spending less than usual.</p>

<p>To be brief, I have now perfected a piece of
household furniture which cannot fail to make its
way if it is set properly on the market. This is a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
combination clothes-horse, screen, step-ladder and
holder for what the French, who can be so clever
with names, call a <i>serviette sans fin</i>; surely a more
picturesque phrase than “circular towel.” My
invention is intended primarily for the kitchen,
but, being on casters, it can easily be moved elsewhere.
I feel sure that never before can one and
the same article have been used for drying
clothes, keeping out a draught, and in hanging
pictures: and small houses must find it invaluable.
The carpenter has carried out my idea with
great skill and the model is here for anyone to
see. I am enclosing a photograph, with dimensions.</p>

<p>All that is needed is a small sum sufficient to
manufacture a thousand or so and to pay the
patent-fee. We can then see how it goes and
arrange for further supplies. I expect it to be a
little gold-mine both for the inventor and for the
fortunate capitalist. I am giving you, dear Aunt
Verena, the first chance. A sum of £500 should
be sufficient to start with.</p>

<p>So much for the business side.</p>

<p>Now for the amusement. A good catchy name
is needed for it, but I have not yet thought of one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
that wholly pleases me. The name should cover
all its many functions and yet be short and
snappy. I thought of “Steppo,” but that disregards
the clothes-horse and screen; or “Klowscrene,”
but that takes no note of the ladder. It
occurred to me that you might find entertainment
on your bed of sickness (which I trust you are
soon to leave) in puzzling out something suitable.</p>

<p>You must not think of me as for one moment
wanting something for nothing. I should never
do that. All I propose is an alliance between my
restless brains and your dormant bank balance
which might be profitable to both of us.</p>

<p>Again wishing you a speedy recovery, I am,
yours sincerely,</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Horace</span></p>

<p><i>P.S.</i>—I suppose it would hardly do to call it

know the phrase, and admirers of Coventry Patmore
might be shocked.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Aunt Verena</span>,—I am most awfully
sorry to hear from Hazel about your accident. I
hope it’s only a blighty and that you will soon be
fit again. As I am a great believer in good news
as a buck-me-up, I hasten to tell you before anyone
else that I am engaged to be married. Every
one has always said that I should be all the better
for settling down, and really with such a pet as
Trixie I am sure they are right. I have not
known her very long—we met at a dance at
Prince’s—but there are some people that you feel
in a minute or so you have known all your life,
and she is one of them. If you were not so ill I
should bring her to see you at once.</p>

<p>She has fair hair, bobbed, and her father is a
swell in the India Office. I have not met either
him or her mother yet, but Trixie is to let me
know directly a favourable opportunity occurs
and then I shall butt in. I rather dread the interview,
as Mr. Parkinson—that’s her father’s name—is
said to be dashed peppery and to have set his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
heart on her marrying coin; but I daresay I shall
pull myself together and play the game. Meanwhile
Trixie wants to keep the engagement a
secret; and except for two or three pals you are
the only person I have told. I haven’t even told
Hazel.</p>

<p>I ought to tell you that she can drive a car and
knows all about them, so she ought to be really
a helpmate, as all wives should be, don’t you
think? She is nearly eighteen and as I am nearly
twenty it is splendid. I have always believed
that husbands ought to be older than their wives.
It gives them authority. We are thinking of taking
our honeymoon in a two-seater on which I
have had my eye for some time; but it is rather
costly. Everything costs such a lot nowadays.
Trixie says she finds me such a relief after so
many soldiers. You see, having been in the
Army such a short time, I am almost, she says, a
civilian; really her first civilian friend; but of
course if the War hadn’t stopped I should still be
a soldier too.—Your sincere nephew,</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Roy</span></p>

<p><i>P.S.</i>—I’m awfully sorry about your being

can become, one must always remember that they
are a race apart, members of a secret society,

champagne, which is light and easily digested, she
has to take stout, which, poor girl, lies heavily on

learn Omar: say, two quatrains a day. It’s the

<p><span class="smcap">Dearest Aunt Verena</span>,—I do hope you are
getting stronger. We are all excited about the
vertical Solitaire table and I long to see it. One
odd and unexpected effect of your illness is to
keep Evangeline quiet and busy. She comes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
home from school now full of importance and
spends hours with her pen. The result, as I think
she has told you, is to be a surprise for you. I
wish I could do something to help you, but can
suggest nothing. Knitting was my only accomplishment
and I’m sure you are not short of
woollies. Having ordered the day’s food, I have
now nothing to do but periodically to eat it, and
to go out of my way to be more than amiable to
the maids for fear of offending and losing them.
You have no notion—you with your divine permanent
staff—of the volcanoes we live on here
and our constant terror of receiving notice. And
this family in particular, because father makes no
effort to control his language (but then no one
does any more, and if “damn” were a word that
infants could lisp they would lisp it—but servants
don’t like it), and mother <i>will</i> give us the
results of séances, which again servants don’t like
or quite understand. Their idea of the dead is
something to be put tidily away in a cemetery and
visited on Sunday afternoons; not talkative spirits
full of messages.</p>

<p>The more I go on in this aimless way the more
I want to break loose and live alone without meals<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
and really do something. I was useful during the
War and now I’m a machine. My only excitement—and
a very doubtful on—is the refusal
of dear cousin Horace, who proposes to me every
other week.—Your loving</p>

<span class="smcap">Louisa Parrish to Verena Raby</span></h2>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Verena</span>,—I have only just heard of
your accident and cannot understand why you
did not let me know sooner. But perhaps, poor
thing, you can’t write. I heard it through the
Hothams, who had been told by Pauline Bankes.
Still even if you can’t write yourself you must
have some one there who can. Dictating is not an
easy thing, I know, but even a postcard would
have been better than nothing, and then I would
have written at once to cheer you up. But if you
do send a postcard, you will be careful, won’t
you, not to put anything very private on it, as
they are all read here. It was how the village
heard of poor Colonel Onslow’s daughter’s elopement.
No doubt you were too ill to think of all
your friends, and yet in the night, when one thinks
of so much, I wonder my name didn’t occur to
you.</p>

<p>Writing letters is no hardship to me, as it is to
so many people. My brother John, for instance,
can’t bring himself to put pen to paper at all, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
his study is always littered up with unanswered
things. It is very odd, I always think, that the
son of so methodical a man as father was should
be so careless, but I expect it is a throwback or
comes from mother’s side. I am much more like
father in so many ways, as well as having the
Parrish nose and the ears set so far forward, while
John and the others favour the Pegrams.</p>

<p>You must let me know if there is anything I
can do for you besides writing now and then.
Of course, if you were able to knit it would be
better, although there is no one to knit for now.
All the girls that I see knitting are working only
for themselves—those jumpers they wear without
corsets, so very indelicate, I think, especially
when the bust is at all full. It is all so different
from the War, when people were really unselfish.
As long as I can remember, I, personally, have
knitted for others; not that I want to take credit
for it, but it is nice to be able to be of service.
When I was a child it was mittens for the gardener
and the coachman or else those poor Deep
Sea Fishermen.</p>

<p>I suppose you have all the books you want.
You have always been so well provided for, but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
there’s a little comforting bedside volume by
Frances Ridley Havergal which I am sending in
case you should want anything of that sort. It
has always helped me, and the other day, after
so many years, I read <i>Queechy</i> again and found
it quite exciting, so I am putting that in too.
Many of the modern books are so <i>outré</i>.</p>

<p>My rheumatism has been rather worse lately,
but I mustn’t tell you things like that when you
are so ill yourself. I should like to know what
your doctor says about you. There was a poor
lady here who slipped and fell and hurt her back,
very much in the same way, I should imagine, and
she lived only a few hours. And dear old Sir
Benjamin Pike, my father’s friend and fellow
magistrate, came to his end in the same way,
through a banana skin. I am sure the regulations
about throwing banana and orange skins away in
the streets should be more strict. In my childhood
we never saw bananas at all, and now they
are everywhere. How odd it is that fashions in
fruit should change as well as fashions in bodies
and in dress, although I for one am against so
much change in dress and think the advertisements
in the weekly papers are dreadful in their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
incitement to women to spend money, especially
now when the Prime Minister tells us we should
all save, and I am sure he is right. And the
money people gave for pearls too, at the Red
Cross sale! Perfectly marvellous where it all
comes from, and how different we all are! Those
millionaires buying pearls for their wives, and me
here quite happy with the mosaic brooch my father
brought me from Venice and the agate clasp
which belonged to dear mother.</p>

<p>I must stop now or I shall miss the post.—Always

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">My Dear</span>, how odd it is that even the sweetest-natured
men, when asked for a fairy tale for the
young, tend to satire. Pure fancy—comic invention
with no <i>arrière pensée</i>—seems to be the most
evasive medium. That mathematical genius,
W. K. Clifford, could do the genuine thing without
one drop of the gall of sophistication, and so,
of course, could Lewis Carroll, and Burne-Jones
in his letters. But when I asked my old friend,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
George Demain, for something amusing and suitable
for a children’s amateur magazine, look at
what he sent! I enclose the original, which please
return. As it is no part of my scheme of life to
teach cynicism, I am withholding it from the
fledgling editors. I don’t mind meeting cynics
(although it is always best that there should be
but one in any company) but I don’t intend consciously
to make any.</p>

<p>One of the extraordinary things of the moment
is how little some men who went through
the War were changed by it all. In fact, it comes
to this, that the War could deal only with what
a man had: it could not create brains or feelings.
The people who talk about it as a purge, an
educator, as discipline and so forth, are saying
what they thought it ought to have been, rather
than what it was. There are clerks in my office
who enlisted and fought and even killed men, and
have now returned to be clerks again, with perfect
resignation, and with no outward sign of development,
except that they do their work with less
care.</p>

<p>I asked one of them what he thought of France
and the French. He had been right through<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
the War and had come, for the first time in his
life, into relations with the French under every
kind of emotional stress. He ought to have had
numbers of stories to tell and national distinctions
to draw. All he said was—“Funny how far
up from the railway platform their trains are!”</p>

<p>I hope all goes as well with you as it can.</p>

<h3>MOTIVES</h3>

<p class="center">[<i>Enclosure</i>]</p>

<p>Once upon a time there was a King who had
never done anything except make laws and draw
his salary, and when he was getting well on in
years he began to wonder if his people really
loved him. He might never have discovered the
answer had not a neighbouring country declared
war against him and threatened to invade his
territory; for “Now,” said the old King, “we will
probe at last into this question of devotion.”</p>

<p>He immediately issued a proclamation that the
country was in danger and that all who wished
to fight could do so but there would be no compulsion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span></p>

<p>So the war began and all the men of the
country flocked to the colours and there was great
excitement.</p>

<p>At the end of a year the army of the old King
had conquered and peace was proclaimed.</p>

<p>The day that the troops returned was a great
holiday. The streets were gay with flags and
banners, and every one came out to welcome the
victors. That night the old King, dressed as a
plain citizen, slipped through his palace gates and
mingled with the crowd. He saw the illuminations
and heard with emotion the joyous songs
and cries of exultation.</p>

<p>Overcome by the noise and rejoicing he turned
down a quiet street and presently he came on a
woman weeping in a doorway. He asked the
cause of her grief and she told him that her husband
had been slain in battle.</p>

<p>“Ah,” said the old King, “I am truly sorry to
hear that, but, after all, there is a consolation in
knowing that he died fighting for his King.”</p>

<p>“I am not so sure,” replied the sorrowing
widow. “We had a quarrel and he went and
joined the army to spite me.”</p>

<p>Farther on the King met a poor old man bowed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
with grief and sighing deeply as he leaned on his
staff.</p>

<p>“How is this, old man?” cried the King. “Why
do you sorrow when so many are gay?”</p>

<p>“Alas,” groaned the other, “I have just heard
that my son was killed in this horrible war.”</p>

<p>“You have cause for sorrow, my friend,” said
the old King sympathetically, “but remember he
fell in a good cause. He died for his King.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps he did,” replied the poor old man.
“But he didn’t say anything about that when he
marched off. He didn’t want to go, as a matter
of fact. Not a bit. But every one else was going
and he was afraid of being thought a coward.”</p>

<p>At the next corner the old King saw a soldier,
one of the victors. He was lame and haggard
and worn and was leaning against a wall to rest.</p>

<p>“Ah!” cried the old King. “You have been
wounded, my young hero?”</p>

<p>The soldier nodded and looked bored.</p>

<p>“Never mind, my lad,” said the old King, patting
him on the shoulder. “We are all proud of
you—and remember, you risked your life in
honour of your King!”</p>

<p>The soldier turned his tired eyes on him and a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
stiff smile made his mouth crooked. “I suppose
that was it,” he said wearily. “I <i>had</i> thought
that I joined up to see a bit of life and have the
girls look at me, but possibly you are right. I
expect it was the King’s honour I was thinking
of.”</p>

<p>So the King returned thoughtfully to his
palace, and as he entered the great hall the
musicians began playing “God keep the King.”
Then all the courtiers who were to receive their
share of the indemnity claimed from the defeated
enemy, and all the commanders who were to receive
titles and honours and large estates, cried
out with one voice “God keep the King!” so that
the people out in the streets heard it and joined
in the shout as if they meant it.</p>

<p>And then the old King went to bed.</p>

<span class="smcap">Horace Mun-Brown to Verena Raby</span></h2>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Aunt</span>,—I am surprised to hear from
Nesta Rossiter that my invention does not strike
you more favourably. I felt sure that you would
like to invest a little in it and at the same time<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
encourage me. But at the moment I am so busy
with a bigger and vastly more attractive project
that I am not so disappointed as I might have
been. This new project is the kind of thing
which I am sure will interest you too, for it involves
the pleasure of a vast number of people.
Briefly, I want to open a Picture Palace in the
heart of the City. As you probably know, the
part of London which is called the City is given
up exclusively to business and eating-houses. But
there are thousands—almost millions—of men
and youths and girls who would rather eat their
lunch in a Picture Palace than in a restaurant,
and see at the same time a drama which might
entertain, instruct, amuse, or quicken their emotions.
This means crowded houses from say
12.15 to 2.30, the audience constantly changing
as their time was up. Then there are also the
employers—the stock-brokers and merchants—who
might like to break the monotony of routine
by seeing the pictures for an hour at any time,
and then there are also errand boys who ought to
be elsewhere. And we can add to these the
number of strangers calling in the City who have
nothing to do when their business is done. I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
think you will agree with me that this is a really
good scheme.</p>

<p>Land is of course expensive, but I am writing
to three or four of the most suitably situated
churches suggesting the possibility of acquiring
their sites and rebuilding them where they are
more needed. The proposal may sound very
revolutionary to you, but my experience is that
the more revolutionary a thing is the more likely
it is to happen. Besides, it is not so revolutionary
as it appears, for these churches are practically
obsolete and I have no doubt whatever that the
vicars would welcome a change.</p>

<p>I hope you are steadily improving. As a good
name for the City Man’s Cinema will be an
advantage, perhaps you would like to be thinking
of one.—Yours sincerely,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Verena</span>, I am finding, to my horror,
that the poets when at their briefest are usually
concerned with mortality: and not necessarily<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
because the space on a tombstone is restricted and
they are writing for the stone-cutter, although
that may have been an influence, but from choice.
Yet as it is my belief that we ought to familiarize
ourselves with the idea of death (and indeed the
War forced us overmuch to do so) you mustn’t
mind an epitaph or two now and then, particularly
when they are beautiful. Or shall we get
them all over at once—and illustrate my discovery
too? The most famous of all, the epitaph
on the Countess Dowager of Pembroke, every one
knows:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Underneath this sable Hearse</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Lies the subject of all verse:</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Fair, and Learn’d, and Good as she,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Time shall throw a dart at thee.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">But I like hardly less the elegy on Elizabeth L. H.
It is longer—longer indeed than the eight-line
limit that we have set ourselves—but I have cut
off the end, which is inferior:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Wouldst thou hear what Man can say</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In a little? Reader, stay.</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">If at all she had a fault,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Leave it buried in this vault.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Then there is Herrick’s “Upon a Child that Died”—another
inspiration:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Here she lies, a pretty bud,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Lately made of flesh and blood:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Who as soon fell fast asleep</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As her little eyes did peep.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Give her strewings but not stir</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The earth that lightly covers her.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">With these, which are Tudor or early Stuart, I
would associate the Scotch epitaph on Miss
Lewars:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Say, sages, what’s the charm on earth</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">It is not purity and worth,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Else Jessie had not died.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">And Stevenson’s best known poem is an epitaph
too:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Under the wide and starry sky</div>

    <div class="verse indent2">And I laid me down with a will.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">This be the verse you grave for me:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Here he lies where he long’d to be;</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Home is the sailor, home from the sea,</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent2"><i>And the hunter home from the hill.</i></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span></p>

<p>But enough of mortality! Let me tell you a
little thing that happened yesterday. An Italian
I used to know, a clerk, who has been in England
for three or four years, came in to say goodbye.
He is going home.</p>

<p>“You’ll be glad to be seeing your wife again
after all this long while,” I said.</p>

<p>He pondered. “My wife, I don’t know,” he
replied at last: “but my leetler boy, Oh, yais!”—Good
night, my dear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Sister</span>,—I hasten to thank you for
the timely case of champagne which you have
sent for Letitia. It will, I am sure, revive her,
even though the vintage is a little immature. I
consider 1911 to be still too young, which reminds
me that it is in the correction of errors such as
this, trifling but easily evitable, that I could be
of so much use to you on the kind of periodical
supervising visit to your establishment (now necessarily
neglected through your most regrettable
accident) which I have before suggested, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
which, even at great personal inconvenience, I
am still ready at any time to pay. At the present
moment, however, it seems to me that a visit from
Letitia would be even more desirable, for when
one is sick and surrounded by comparative
strangers, who should be a more welcome guest
than a sister? And it is long since you two have
met. Apart from the pleasure of reunion, the
little change would do Letitia good. Save for
myself, who am not, I am aware, too vivacious a
companion, the poor dear sees almost no one.
With a slightly augmented income she could take
a place in society here far more appropriate to
her birth; but when one has not the means to
return hospitality one is a little sensitive about
accepting it. Awaiting your reply, I am, your

<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Richard</span>,—This is my first letter
in my own hand and it must be short. I am
very grateful to you. Would not that be a nice<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
epitaph—“He never disappointed”? Well, it is
true of you.</p>

<p>Your idea of the short poems is perfect and I
have already learned some.</p>

<p>Nesta is excellent company, but I fear she is
giving me more time than it is fair to take.
Every now and then, when she is apparently looking
at me, I can see that her glance is really fixed
on her children, many miles off. The far-away
nursery look.</p>

<p>It is <i>almost</i> worth being ill to discover how
kind people can be. If it is true (and of course it
is) that to give pleasure to others is the greatest
happiness, then I can comfort myself, as I lie here
apparently useless, that I have my uses after all,
since I am the cause of that happiness in so many
of my friends.—Yours,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dearest Verena</span>, your testimonial gave me
extraordinary pleasure, and I wish it was true.</p>

<p>I don’t say, in spite of your charming piece of
altruistic reasoning, that you are lucky to be in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
bed, but to have to remain in a remote rural spot
while England is getting herself into order again
is not a bad thing. For it is a slow and rather
unlovely process. Just at the moment War seems,
as one remembers it (and of course I speak only
of England, not of the Front), a more desirable
condition than Peace. There is no doubt that the
country is a fit place for Profiteeroes to live in.</p>

<p>I felt sure that you knew Clifford’s excellent
nonsense for the young. As you don’t know it,
you shall; but not yet! A surprise is brewing.</p>

<p>With the steady assistance of my invaluable
Miss Faith and her little Corona (which is not,
alas! a cigar, but a typewriter) I have amassed
already a collection of brief poems such as may
gently occupy your thoughts in the wakeful sessions
of the night. These I shall dole out to you,
one by one, for you to take or leave as you feel
“dispoged.” I have not gone beyond my own
shelves, but if ever I find myself with the run of
somebody else’s no doubt I shall find many more,
probably equally good or even better. We might
call it the <i>Tabloid Treasury</i> when it is ready?</p>

<p>Having sent you the other day all those elegiac
efforts, I am now copying out three or four short<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
poems where the poets take stock and prepare to
put up the shutters, and here again the quality is
high. The most famous example is, of course,
Landor’s:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">I strove with none, for none was worth my strife;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Nature I loved, and next to Nature, Art;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I warmed both hands before the fire of life;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">It sinks, and I am ready to depart.</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Aunt</span>,—If I have from time to time
bothered you with my financial schemes I am very
sorry. But I have an active brain, and too few
briefs. Also I want to be in a sound financial
position, and, under more favourable circumstances,
most of my projects would, I am sure,
succeed. But you are the only capitalist that I
know, and just at the moment you are, I now
realize, not in a position to take any deep interest
in monetary ventures. I ought to have thought of
this before, and I apologise.</p>

<p>I write to you to-day for a very different purpose
and that is, to enlist not your bank balance
but your sympathy and, I hope, active help. In
a nutshell, I want to marry Hazel. I have laid
my case before her more than once, but she refuses
to take me seriously. I am aware that I am not
so superficially gay and insouciant as the majority
of the young men of to-day; I know only too well
that I cannot jazz and that I prefer dances where
an intervening atmospheric space divides the partners.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
But, though I may be old-fashioned, surely
I have compensating qualities of value in married
life. What I feel is that if only Hazel could be
persuaded that I am in deadly earnest, and that
marriage is not one of—what she calls—my
“wild-cat schemes,” she would begin to look upon
me with a new eye. I am very human <i>au fond</i>,
dear Aunt, and, in my own way, I adore Hazel.
Would you not try to persuade her to be more
kind and understanding?—I am, your affectionate
nephew,</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Horace Mun-Brown</span></p>

<p><i>P.S.</i>—On reading this letter through, I find
that I have made what looks rather like a pun—that
passage about Hazel and a nutshell. I assure
you, my dear Aunt, it was unintentional. I
should never joke about love.</p>

noticed it and commented upon it.</p>

<p>“You look very sad this morning,” she said.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
“But then,” she added, “ladies generally do.”</p>

<p>“Why is that?” Violet asked.</p>

<p>“They have such difficult lives,” she said. “It’s
their husbands, I think.”</p>

<p>“But you have a husband.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but we don’t notice our husbands as
much as you do. They come in and they’re cross
and they swear, and we let them. We’ve got
our work to get on with. But with ladies it’s
different; they take notice.”</p>

<span class="smcap">Clemency Power to the Hon. Mrs. Power</span></h2>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Dearest Mother</span>,—I have got a job at last—the
least like a War job that you could imagine.
I have been engaged to read for an hour or so
every day to a Miss Raby, a lady who owing to
an accident has to lie still for months and months.
After all my adventures in France this is a great
change.</p>

<p>Miss Raby lives near Kington in Herefordshire,
a long way from London and indeed a long
way from anywhere, but it is fine country and
there are splendid hills to walk on, Hargest
Ridge in particular, where the air is the most
bracing I ever knew, and you look over to the
Welsh mountains. She has an old spacious house
in its own grounds, but I am lodging with one
of the villagers; which I greatly prefer. Miss
Raby has a nurse, and one of her nieces, a Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
Rossiter, who is charming, is with her. I am a
sort of extra help and am gradually being allowed
to do more and more and now have had the picking
of the flowers entrusted to me.</p>

<p>Miss Raby herself is the sweetest creature, a
kind of ideal aunt. She is somewhere in the
forties, I suppose, and had a very full life, in a
quiet way, before she was ill, and she is very
brave in bearing her inactivity, which must be
terribly irksome at times and especially in very
fine weather. I am here nominally to read, but
we talk most of the time, and she is never tired
of hearing about the War and all my experiences.
She knows the part of the garden that every flower
comes from, and I think her greatest joy every
day is her interview with the gardener.</p>

<p>One thing I have discovered is how very few
books bear reading aloud. The authors don’t
think of that when they are writing and so the
words are wrongly placed. Another thing is that
books that are silly anyway are heaps sillier when
read aloud.</p>

<p>I ought to say that although I am in Miss
Raby’s service (don’t wince) she is not my employer—I
was engaged by a Mr. Haven, her oldest<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
friend, who has presented me to her!—Your

<span class="smcap">Verena Raby to Hazel Barrance</span></h2>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Dearest Hazel</span>,—I have had a rather pathetic
letter from poor Horace, who, after long
wooing you in vain, comes to me (I hope this
isn’t betraying his confidence: I don’t think it is
really) as a new legal Miles Standish. Young
men at the Bar are not usually so ready to seek
other mouthpieces, are they? Not those, at any
rate, next to whom I used to sit at dinner parties
in the days when I was well and now and then
came to London.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span></p>

<p>Of course, my dear child, I am not going to
interfere. To be quite candid, I don’t want you
to marry Horace. I think you would condemn
yourself to a very stuffy kind of existence if you
did, and I am against first-cousins marrying in
any case. But his appeal gives me an opportunity
of saying what I have more than once wished, and
that is that you would revise your general attitude
to marriage. Again and again in your letters
to me I have detected a bitterness about it,
the suggestion that because some couples have
fallen out, all must sooner or later do so. This
isn’t true. But even if it were, it ought not to
deter us, for all of us must live our own lives, and
make our own experiments, and all of us ought
to believe that we are the great splendid triumphant
exceptions! It is that belief—I might
almost call it religion—which I miss in you and
which seems to be now so generally lacking. Put
on low grounds it might be called the gambling
spirit, but it is a form of gambling in which there
is no harm, but rather virtue. I often wish that
I had had more of it, but I was unfortunate in having
my affections so enchained by one who too little
knew his mind, nor sufficiently valued his captive,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
that I was never free to consider offers.</p>

<p>Marriage may always be a lottery and often
turn out disastrously, and even more often be a
dreary curtailment of two persons’ liberty, but it
is a natural proceeding and, unless one utterly
denies any purpose in life, a necessary one; and
I am all in favour of young people believing in it.
I wish that you were braver and healthier about
it, but I don’t want you to become Mrs. Horace
Mun-Brown, and I am telling him so.</p>

<p>This is the longest letter I have written since
I took to my bed; indeed I believe it is the longest
I ever wrote.—Your loving</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Sister</span>,—I was grieved to learn
from a third party that you are no better; indeed
rather worse. Letitia and I were hoping that
every day showed improvement. In the possibility
that one deterrent cause may be too much
thought, it has occurred to us that the presence
in the house, to be called upon whenever needed,
of a soothing voice, might be a great solace and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
aid. Such a voice transmitting the words of the
poets, the philosophers or even the romancers,
could not but distract the mind of the listener
from her own anxieties and gradually induce repose.
Letitia, to whom I have been reading for
some years, will tell you—with more propriety

<p><span class="smcap">Dearest Mummy</span>,—When you come home
you will find another baby here, only it isn’t a
real baby, it’s a puppy. A spaniel. Mr. Hawkes
gave it to us and he says we are to own it together
so that each of us has a bit. He says I
am to have its stomach and mouth, which means
I have got to feed it, and Cyril is to have its front
legs and ears, and Lobbie its hind legs and tail,
and its tongue is to belong to us all. I have told
Cyril that you and Daddy ought to have an ear
each but he won’t give them up. The ears of a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
spaniel are the nicest part, next to the lips. It
is a girl and Mr. Hawkes says that this means
that when it grows up it will be fondest of Cyril.
We have named it Topsy because it is a girl and
black. Do come home soon and see it.—Your

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Aunt</span>,—You were the kindest thing to
write to me like that. Such a long letter too!
I hope you weren’t too tired after it. But, alas!
the pity is it has not converted me. Marriage for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
every one else if you like, but not for me. I have
seen too much of it, nor do I seem to want any of
the things it gives except escape from home. But
it would be escaping only to another form of
bondage. Every one is not made for domesticity
and I am sure I am not. I hate everything to do
with the preparation of meals. I even rather hate
meals themselves and would much prefer to eat
only when I felt hungry, a little at a time and
fairly often and alone. The idea of munching for
evermore punctually and periodically opposite the
same man both repels and infuriates me. I wonder
if you can understand this. The thought of
Horace under these conditions is too revolting.</p>

<p>Since I wrote to you Horace has actually been
to father, behind my back; but father is much too
pleased with my likeness to himself to be unsporting,
and Horace was sent away with the
warning that he hadn’t an earthly—but if he
cared to persist he must come to me direct and to
no one else. He would have gone to mother for
a cert if she had not been so wholly occupied with
the affairs of the next world.</p>

<p>Father was really funny about it. “What does
Horace want to marry for, anyway?” he said:<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
“he knows how to speak French”—this referring
to his old theory that what men most want in
wives is a gift of tongues when travelling abroad.</p>

<p>But apart from not wanting to marry, marriage
frightens me. It means losing the fine edge of
courtesy and kindness and tenderness. I see so
many married people—girls I knew when they
were engaged—one or two to whom I was bridesmaid
and they are all so coarsened by it and
take things so for granted. I don’t think anything
is sadder than the way in which little pretty
indulged sillinesses when a girl is engaged, become
detestable in her husband’s eyes after they are
married. Losing umbrellas, for example.</p>

<p>That’s the end of my grumbling about marriage.
This correspondence, as the editors say,
must now cease, and henceforth I will write only
when I have something cheerful and amusing to
tell you. I have been selfishly using you far too
long.—Your loving</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My Dear</span>, I am delighted to hear about my
Irish girl. Some day I should like to be ill myself—nicely,
languidly ill, without pain—just for
the pleasure of having her read to me.</p>

<p>I hope you aren’t letting the papers prey on
your mind. Far better not read them, or, rather,
not hear them read; but I expect that is to suggest
too much. After a great war there must always
be a period of ferment and unrest, and that is
what we are undergoing now. I don’t in the least
despair of cosmos emerging, but nothing will ever
be the same again and it will be a very expensive
chaos for years to come.</p>

<p>What chiefly worries me is the impaired standard
of efficiency, the scamping, the cheating and
the general cynicism. I seem to discern a universal
decrease of pride. The best, the genuine,
has gone, and substitutes reign. Tradespeople no
longer keep their word and are impenitent when
taxed with it. A certain amount of dishonesty
must, I suppose, be bred of a war. Officers, for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
example, had to be fed and couldn’t be expected
to inquire too closely of their batmen where the
chickens came from, and no doubt a good deal of
this bivouacking morality persists. But I wish it
hadn’t affected life so generally. I rather fancy
that what this old England of ours is most in
need of is a gentleman at the helm. A nobleman
would not be bad, but a gentleman would be better.
No harm if he were rich and could win the
Derby. But where to find him? He is a gift of
the gods, to be proffered or withheld according to
their whim or their interest in old England. If
they are tired of us (as now and then one can
almost fear), then we may never get him.—Yours,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Hazel</span>,—My last letter too, on this
subject, but you must answer it. There is much
in yours with which I sympathize and I think I
understand all of it. There is a vein of almost
fierce fastidiousness in our family (your grandfather
had too much of it) which is discernible in
you, but I don’t despair of seeing a deal of it
broken down when you meet the right man. So
much of what you say about things seems to me
to be due to your manlessness. I don’t believe
that any wholly right view of life is possible to
celibates or those who have never loved. They
must see it piecemeal. I don’t despair of you at
all, but you must get out of the habit of expecting
perfection. And where would the fun of marriage

one mad daughter out in the world when there is
no need for it is enough. I can’t make her see
that it isn’t the money that matters, but the importance
of doing something for the sake of one’s
own dignity. All the same, some one must of
course stay with her. I’m sure that if I were to

shillelaghs and he was fearful of a fight. But it
was great fun. Dr. O’Connor was there with his
new wife, very massive and handsome, and he
was so comically proud of her, and Mr. Sheehan
was as mischievous as ever and even invited us to
play lawn tennis at Derreen by moonlight. It
would have been funny if we had and Lord Lansdowne
had turned up. We walked round the
lake once, with the cripples, and gave shillings to

<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Aunt</span>,—Just one more word, then!—but
only to say it’s no good, I can’t agree with
you. The idea of marriage being necessarily warfare
is utterly repugnant to me, and unless a
miracle happens I shall continue to go on doing
my best to be happy though single. I see no
reason whatever for people to scrap, and those
who like it always fill me with a kind of disgust.
Married life should be all friendliness and niceness.
I feel so strongly about married happiness
that I believe if I were asked to name my favorite
poem in all poetry I should give the old epitaph
on the husband who so quickly followed his wife
to the grave:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Doctor</span>,—It was very nice of you to
write and I am sorry that I missed those other
letters. If you kept them, please send them on.
I am now in a very different employment from
that which I had when we used to meet. I am
reader to an invalid lady—not, I hope, a permanent
invalid, and most emphatically not one
of your desired <i>malades imaginaires</i>—who lives
in a beautiful house in Herefordshire. My duties
are not confined to reading aloud but comprise a
hundred other things and I am very happy. I
don’t say that I don’t often regret those rough
jolly boys, but one could not wish the War to last
longer just for one’s own entertainment. I wonder
how some of our old friends are—that poor
Madame La Touche, does she still carry round
the bill of damage done and horses taken which
the Germans some day are to pay? And old
Gaston, are his repentances and good resolutions<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
any more binding? How long ago it all seems,
and, though so real, how like a dream! I hope
you will find a practice to your mind, but I am
sure you don’t really want an idle one. I know

<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Verena</span>,—I was glad to have your
niece’s letter saying that you are progressing
nicely. I am so afraid of those falls, and you
never know even when you feel well again
whether there may not be some underlying trouble
to break out again at any moment. We shall
all pray that nothing of the kind will happen to
you. I can’t help wishing that you had the advantage
of being attended by our dear Dr. Courage.
He is so clever and kind and thoughtful.</p>

<p>My rheumatism has been troubling me again<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
lately and nothing seems to do it any good. I
deny myself sugar and potatoes and everything
that is said to foster it, but to no purpose. I
fear it is so deep-seated that I shall be a martyr
to it all my life, but there is this consolation that
they say that people who have rheumatism seldom
have anything else. In this world we can’t
expect to be too happy.</p>

<p>We have been in great trouble lately through
want of maids. I don’t know what has come over
the servant class, but they don’t seem to value a
good place at all any more. Maid after maid
has been here and has left. Whether it is that
we haven’t a cinema near, or what, I don’t know,
but they won’t stay. And the wages they ask
are terrible. It seems to me that the world has
gone mad. The wonderful thing is that they can
always find some one to carry their boxes, and
they get away so quickly. Not that we have ever
missed anything, but they seem to decide to go all
of a sudden, and no kind of consideration for us,
and me with my rheumatism, ever stops them.

Martha our cook went on for ever at I am sure

<span class="smcap">Richard Haven to Verena Raby</span></h2>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Verena</span>, my dear, <i>apropos</i> of the newspapers
and your dread of all their alarms and excursions,
don’t believe everything you read. Fleet Street
has to live, and it can do so only by selling its
papers, which have first to be filled. Take, as an
example of exaggeration, the outcry against Departmental
inefficiency as if it were a new thing.
It has always been the same, only the scale was
larger during the War and after it. There have
always been round pegs in square holes, and disregard
of public money, and, as I happen to know,
improper destruction of documents.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span></p>

<p>You say you want a story now and then. Well,
here is one from my own experience, gathered as
it happens in the very country the violation of
which brought us into the struggle, and bearing
upon official cynicism too.</p>

<p>Some years ago, I was travelling by a small
cross-country railway in Belgium. It was a bad
train at all times, but on this occasion it behaved
with alarming eccentricity: at one time tearing
along by leaps and bounds, and then becoming
snailier than the snailiest, until at last, just outside
a station, it stopped altogether. We waited
and waited; nothing happened; and so first one
passenger and then another alighted to see what
was the matter, until gradually every one of us
was on the line. Why the train did not immediately
rush on and leave us all behind I cannot
say; but, as you will agree, it might easily have
done so, for when we reached the engine it was
discovered that both the driver and stoker were
gloriously and wildly drunk.</p>

<p>There are never lacking leaders on such occasions
as these—and we quickly had several,
equally noisy; but by degrees some kind of policy
was agreed upon, and we all marched in a foolish<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
procession to the station behind the group of three
gentlemen who led us, and who walked (and
stumbled over the sleepers) abreast, either sideways
or backwards as they thought of new words
and new gestures to apply to the outrage. At the
station we were met by the station-master, and a
battle of explanations and protests and repetitions
set in and was waged terrifically, the issue
of which was the production of a large sheet of
paper on which we all, one by one, signed our
names beneath a record of the offence, with the
date and place carefully noted. By the time this
was done the station-master had managed to find
a new and sober driver and stoker, and the train
could resume its journey.</p>

<p>I—perhaps because I was English, and there
was nothing to gain—happened to be the last to
sign, and therefore the last to rejoin the train.
As I was getting into it I found that I had
left my pipe in the office, and I hurried back to
recapture it. I was just in time to see the station-master
placing the last of the pieces of the torn-up
manifesto on the fire.</p>

<p>After that I feel that you must have something<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
more than usually beautiful in the way of a short
poem. Try this:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Here lies a most beautiful lady,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Light of step and heart was she;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I think she was the most beautiful lady</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">That ever was in West Country.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But beauty vanishes; beauty passes;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">However rare—rare it be;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And when I crumble, who will remember</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">This lady of the West Country?</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Having copied that out it occurs to me that
it is almost too personal and memento-mori-ish.
Let me hasten to say that the part of the West
Country indicated is not Herefordshire but, let
us say, Gloucestershire. How careful one always
has to be—and isn’t!</p>

<span class="smcap">Horace Mun-Brown to Verena Raby</span></h2>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Aunt</span>,—I had anticipated your objection
to the marriage of first-cousins, which is
one of your arguments against my courtship of
Hazel. An acquaintance of mine who is connected
with a statistical laboratory has long been
making enquiries into the whole matter of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
consanguinity, and the results are surprising. The
children of first-cousins are by no means doomed
to imbecility or decadence. But even if they were
that should not necessarily deter me, for the union
of Hazel and myself might prove to be childless,
although none the less happy for that, and it
would be grievous and tragic to permit a superstition
to keep us sundered.</p>

<p>But I am letting the whole matter rest for a
while and endeavouring to soothe my fever by
concentrating once again on financial schemes.
For without money I have no home to offer any
wife. You will remember my project, in which I
still believe implicitly, for establishing a Cinema
in the City? Well, it has fallen through. The
reply from the only churchwarden who has been
polite enough to answer my very courteous letter
is unsatisfactory. He displays an antiquated reluctance
to come into line with the march of progress.
And as the price of ordinary building land
in the neighbourhood of Cheapside is prohibitive
I must reluctantly abandon the notion either as
unripe or as unsuited to my hands. But I am
sure I was on the right track.</p>

<p>I now have a new and more practical scheme<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
to unfold. While walking down the Strand yesterday
I made a curious discovery in which I am
sure you will be interested. I noticed that in
the whole street there is no shop devoted to
woman’s dress—not even a milliner’s. Considering
that the Strand is always too full of people of
both sexes and that it is largely a pleasure street—I
mean that the people have time to look about
and money to spend—this is a very strange thing
and I am sure there would be big profits in remedying
it. My idea is to find the capital for an
emporium to be established somewhere in the
neighbourhood of the Beaver Hut, where men and
women are passing the whole time; visitors to
London—staying at the Savoy and other great
hotels—many of them very wealthy Americans;—people
arriving at Charing Cross from Kent
(one of the richest counties); and so on. How
natural for the men to wish to give the women
something pretty to wear!—to say nothing of the
women’s own constant desire for new clothes and
hats.</p>

<p>All that is needed is a certain amount of capital
to build and stock with, and the services of a first-class
man from one of the big Oxford Street<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
places to act as manager. If you are sufficiently
interested in the scheme to invest in it, please let
me know the amount.</p>

<p>I hope you are better. I have one of my bad
attacks of nasal catarrh.—Yours sincerely,</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Aunt Verena</span>,—I am broken-hearted
and turn first to you for sympathy as you are
always so kind and all my pals are out of town.
The fact is, Trixie and I have parted for ever.
I can’t explain how it happened, because my brain
is all in a whirl about it, and really I don’t know,
but somehow I offended her and it is all off. My
life is a blank and all the plans I had made are
mockeries. I had even begun to look in furniture-shop
windows. And then it all went wrong, and
when I got to the Jazzle Ball a little bit late,
which I couldn’t help, I found that she had given
every dance away to other men, one of whom is
an officer bounder whom I had most carefully<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
warned her against: a regular T.G. (Temporary
Gentleman) of the worst type.</p>

<p>I wish you were better so that I might come
and talk to you about it all. I could tell you in
words so much more than I can write, especially
with the mouldy pens at this Club. The only
satisfactory part is that I had not bought the
engagement ring, not having enough money for
it. I don’t mean that I should regret the money
but that I should hate to receive the blighted
thing back. As it is I had not given her anything
but chocolates, and of course we exchanged
cigarette cases: but I don’t intend to use hers any
more. I could not enjoy a cigarette from a case
so fraught with memories.</p>

<p>If I were a little more independent I should try
to forget my sorrows in travel, but I can’t. And
dancing has ceased to interest me. In fact, I believe
it is this dancing that is very largely the
matter with England. If we danced less and
worked more I am sure we should be “winning
the Peace” more thoroughly. If you have any
ideas for me of a strenuous kind I should like to
hear of them, for I am all for toil now. I have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>

<p>The hospital in France is just closing and I

I say rural because the desire to be in old England

<p><span class="smcap">Darling Vin</span>,—It is dreadful, but father
won’t hear of an engagement. He is so absurdly
old-fashioned and does not realize that everything
has changed. No doubt when he was your age,
long ago in the eighteen-nineties, people could
wait for each other; but why should we? I don’t
suppose that then they even knew how to kiss.
He says the most ridiculous things. He says that
a girl ought to know a man at least for a year and
that twenty-one is the earliest age at which she
should marry. Why, Juliet was only about fourteen
when she was betrothed to Romeo, and lots
of Indian girls are widows before our hair is up.
And what is the sense of love at first sight if you
have to wait? Father also says that aviation is
not a desirable profession for a son-in-law, entirely
forgetting that half the fun of our marriage
will be the flying honeymoon.</p>

<span class="smcap">Theodore Raby to Verena Raby</span></h2>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Old V.</span>,—If Josey writes to you for
sympathy in her struggle with a stern and heartless
parent, please oblige me and help the little
idiot (bless her, all the same!) by supporting me.</p>

<p>These are the cold facts. She is eighteen and
has been frivolling far too much, largely because
she has no mother and I have been too much occupied
to attend to her properly. Also because
the War made frivolling too easy by fledging so
many infants at lightning speed. Among the acquaintances
that she has picked up at this and
that <i>thé dansant</i> is a flying boy, and, just because
other boys and girls have married in haste, she
must needs insist on marrying in haste too. No
doubt she thinks herself in love and no doubt also
he does, although I shouldn’t be surprised to find
that he is more pursued than pursuing, as is so
often the case now; but the whole thing is derivative
really, and I can’t have my one little Precious<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
thrown away on an experiment in imitation.</p>

<p>The bore is that—to such a pass has the world
come!—she might at any moment perform the
Gretna Green act. Self-restraint, you see, is a
little out of fashion up here: we all live for ourselves
now, to the great detriment of the Human
Family which peace was to consolidate. To forbid
her to see the boy seems to me a mistake. If
you were well I should ask you to invite her to
the country, but you are not well, my poor dear,
and she wouldn’t go even if you were—not so
long as her warrior is accessible. And he seems
to be always in town, the exceptional perils of the
air being, it appears, compensated for by exceptional
opportunities of leave.</p>

<p>So far as I can gather he is a decent young
fellow and he may be on my side—but he doesn’t
come and see me and it seems rather absurd to
go to see him. The new soldier, and especially
when he flies, is not to be found at home too
easily! This one seems to be the usual enfranchised
public-school boy—to whom the wonders
and mysteries of life are either top-hole or
incomprehensible, or both, and an eclipse of the
sun would be merely a “solar stunt.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span></p>

<p>Even if Josey had her foolish way I don’t suppose
that the end of the world would arrive, but
it would be sad and disappointing and I am certain
that she would very quickly regret her impetuosity.—Yours
as ever,</p>

you rarely saw him smoking during work. I am

<p>“But,” I said to a man the other week when
he was blaming one of his messengers for an unpardonable
delay, “if he behaves like that, it is
your business as an employer to sack him.”</p>

<p>“Sack him!” he replied blankly. “Employers
don’t give the sack any more; they get it.”</p>

<p>And this is true.</p>

<p>But a change must come, and the interesting
thing to see will be how complete that change is.
One thing is certain, and that is that Capital and
Labour will never resume their old relations;
Labour has tasted too much blood. And you
can’t put servants into khaki and tell them they
are our saviours and then expect them to return
to the status of servitude—at any rate not the
same ones. The process of grinding the working
classes back to their old position of subjection is
going to be impossible; and the statesmen will
find that reconstruction must be based on foundations<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
which are set on a higher level than the old.</p>

<p>A man in the train gave me a new definition
of the extreme of meanness: Saving a rose from
Queen Alexandra’s Day for use again next year.</p>

<span class="smcap">Verena Raby to Her Brother Walter in
Texas</span></h2>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Walter</span>,—It is far too long since I
wrote to you, but now I have only too much time
for letters, as an accident hurt my back and I
have to lie up with too little to do.</p>

<p>I wonder so often how you are, and you never
send a line, nor does Sally. You are the only one
of our family of whom no one ever hears. Do
make a great effort and answer this and tell me
all about yourself and your life on the ranch. It
must be so very different from ours. If you have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
a camera, couldn’t you send some photographs?
Remember I have never seen Sally. I don’t even
know if there are any children.</p>

<p>The garden to-day looks lovely from my window.
The old place has not changed much since
our childish days, but the trees are higher. I have
done very little to it beyond keeping it in repair
and installing electric light, which is made by an
oil engine, and a few modern things like that.
There are more bath-rooms, for instance. One of
them has been made out of that funny little bedroom
where the rat came down the chimney and
you brought up one of your young terriers to kill
it and the dog was afraid and it nearly broke
your heart. You haven’t forgotten that?</p>

<p>The big playroom at the top I have not touched.
It has the same wall-paper. Whenever any of
the others—I mean the girls—come to see me and
we go up there we always have a good cry. The
screen with the <i>Punch</i> drawings, the big doll’s
house, the rocking horse: they are still there. Little
Lobbie, Nesta’s second child (Nesta is Lucilla’s
daughter, who married an artist), plays
there now. Nesta is staying here to keep me company
while I am ill. I don’t have any pain; I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
merely have to lie still and give the spine a chance.</p>

<p>Kington has grown very little. There are new
houses near the station and we have a municipal
park! That is about all. But it isn’t what it
was—probably no English town is since the motor
car came into being. Some may be better, but
I think that Kington has deteriorated and very
few of our friends remain. Mr. and Mrs. Grace
are still living at the Tower, but alone and very
old; all the family has dispersed. One thing that
has not changed is the temperature of the church;
which is still cold. But there is a long—too long—Roll
of Honour in the porch. How you must
have regretted that lameness of yours when the
War broke out!</p>

<p>I manage to keep in touch with most of us,
chiefly through their children. Letitia I never
see. I should like to, but she is not strong, and
Tunbridge Wells is a long way off, and it is impossible
to detach her from her husband, whom
we rather avoid. I am afraid she is not happy,
but I can do very little to help. Clara’s son and
daughter—Roy and Hazel—are very lively correspondents,
and Evangeline, their youngest, seems
a thoughtful child; but I fear that Hector Barrance<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
can be rather difficult at times. Theodore’s
only girl is just eighteen. Anna’s boy Horace is
a rather serious young man at the Bar. Lionel is
still unmarried; he was made a C.B.E. in the War.
Ronald is also unmarried and I hear from him
now and then, but his duties keep him very close
in Edinburgh. Every one is very kind to me in
my illness, Richard Haven—you remember him?—writing
every day. He is fixed in London.
Nellie Sandley, whom you were so sweet upon
that summer at Lyme Regis, died last week, poor
girl, of pneumonia.</p>

<p>I wonder if all this interests you in the least,
or if your new life in your new country is all-absorbing.
It would be delightful to see you
again. But at any rate do write and send some
photographs if you can. Write directly you get
this and then a longer letter later.—Your loving
sister,</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Verena</span></p>

<p><i>P.S.</i>—I often wonder if you would not like the
series of hunting scenes by Alken that used to
be in the dining-room. Let me know and I will
send them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Theo</span>,—How very delightful to

woe. I don’t want you to have more of such perplexities,
but I do want to have another letter. It
was odd too because I was just beginning a long
one to Walter asking for his news and telling him
mine.</p>

<p>If Josey writes to me, you may be sure I will
be on your side—but can’t you get her something
to do? It is idleness and enough money to buy
new frocks that lead to these problems. I should
like her to come here, but, as you say, she wouldn’t

<h3>PEOPLE WHO REALLY DESERVE THE O.B.E.</h3>

<h4>I. COOK</h4>

<p>If ever there was a heroine in real life it is Cook. She
has to be all the time in the kitchen even when the sun
shines and the birds are singing. The kitchen must be
hot or the things wouldn’t be properly done for dinner.</p>

<p>She is always cooking things for other people and she
doesn’t get anything to eat till they have finished, although
of course she can taste as she goes along. This
is a delicious thing to do, and when she is in a good humour
she lets us dip our fingers in, but usually she says
“Don’t stop here hindering me.”</p>

<p>She never goes out except to see if there is another
egg or to pick mint or parsley or to talk to the butcher’s
boy, who is terrified of her. Sometimes she has to catch
a chicken and kill it and afterwards she has to pluck it.</p>

<p>Our cook is very fat and when she goes upstairs she
holds her side and pants. On Sundays she doesn’t go
to Church but to Chapel and she wears very bright
colours. She had a lover once but he died. His portrait
is in her bedroom with his funeral card under it.
She says that her troth is in the tomb with him and never
can she marry another. She also says that the talk
about cooks and policemen having a natural attraction
for each other is nonsense.</p>

<p>Her masterpieces are apple charlotte, bread-and-butter
pudding, and Lancashire hot pot. She also makes delicious
stews, which are better than other cooks’, mother
says, because she fries the vegetables first.</p>

<p>Her name is Gladys Mary but we call her Cook. She
says that after a certain age, cooks have the right to be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
called Mrs., but that she is a very long way from that
age herself.</p>

<p>We are all horribly afraid that she will give notice,
because a new one would be so hard to get. There is
nothing we wouldn’t do for her. She could cook as
badly as she liked and no one would dare to say anything.
But she cooks beautifully.</p>

<p>She truly deserves the O.B.E.</p>

<h3>RULES AS TO BIRTHDAYS<br />
FOR THE BENEFIT OF PARENTS</h3>

<p>The person whose birthday it happens to be should be
allowed to get up when they choose. There should be
sausages for breakfast.</p>

<p>It seems hardly necessary to point out that there
should be no lessons, and no walk.</p>

<p>Lunch should be chosen by the birthday person.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Sample Menu for a Birthday Lunch:—</p>

<ul>
<li>Roast Chicken.</li>
<li>Bread Sauce.</li>
<li>Green Peas.</li>
<li>Squiggly Potatoes.</li>
<li>Trifle, with chocolate éclairs as an alternative.</li>
</ul>

</div>

<p>In choosing birthday presents people should remember
that the whole point of a present is that it is an extra.
Clothes should never be given for birthday presents,
because one <i>has</i> to have clothes and it is not at all
exciting to be given a pair of stockings. Handkerchiefs
do not count as clothes because they are pretty.</p>

<p>Some really good entertainment should be arranged
for the afternoon. If in London a matinée is suggested,
followed by tea at Rumpelmayer’s. Bedtime should
come at least two hours later than usual. If only these
few simple rules could be committed to memory by
those in authority what completely satisfactory occasions
birthdays would be.</p>

<h3>A FABLE</h3>

<p>There was once a pine wood on the slope of a hill, and
in the middle of the wood was a lovely silver birch which
could not grow as it should because the pine trees were
so closely packed about it.</p>

<p>Instead of being sorry for it, the pine trees were insulting.</p>

<p>“What are you doing here anyway?” they said.
“You weren’t invited. This is a pine wood. Why aren’t
you out there on the common, among the brake fern, with
all the others of your finicking useless tribe? Who
wants silver birches? They do no good in the world.”
And so on.</p>

<p>The silver birch, who was a perfect lady, made no
reply.</p>

<p>And then a war came and it was necessary to get
timber for all kinds of purposes, and all over the country
the woods were cut down, among them this pine wood,
for pine is very useful for planks for building huts.</p>

<p>The men came with their axes and felled tree after
tree, but when they reached the silver birch they said,
“We’ll leave this—it’s no good for timber, and when all
these others are gone it will have a chance.”</p>

<p>And so it was left, and soon it stood all alone and very
beautiful, surrounded by the dead bodies of the unkind
pine trees, absolute queen of the hill.</p>

<p>Being a perfect lady it still said nothing to them, nor
had it even smiled as they tottered and fell.</p>

<p>The moral is that every one’s good time <i>may</i> come.</p>

<h3>STRAY THOUGHTS ON PARENTS</h3>

<p>Parents are always saying that they once were children
too, but they give no signs of it.</p>

<p>It is a peculiarity of parents that they always want you
to change your boots.</p>

<p>Parents have several set forms of speech, of which
“You seem to think I’m made of money” is one, and
“I never did that when I was your age” is another.
They also wonder “What the world is coming to.”</p>

<p>Parents live in houses, usually in the best rooms.
They can’t bear doors either to be left open or shut
with a bang.</p>

<p>A funny thing about parents is that they can find
interesting reading in newspapers.</p>

It was written by a mathematician and philosopher

<h3>THE GIANT’S SHOES<br />
<span class="smaller">BY W. K. CLIFFORD</span></h3>

<p>Once upon a time there was a large giant who lived in a
small castle: at least, he didn’t all of him live there, but
he managed things in this wise. From his earliest youth
up his legs had been of a surreptitiously small size,
unsuited to the rest of his body: so he sat upon the
south-west wall of the castle with his legs inside, and his
right foot came out of the east gate, and his left foot out
of the north gate, while his gloomy but spacious coat-tails
covered up the south and west gates; and in this
way the castle was defended against all comers, and was
deemed impregnable by the military authorities. This,
however, as we shall soon see, was not the case, for the
giant’s boots were inside as well as his legs: but as he
had neglected to put them on in the giddy days of his
youth, he was never afterwards able to do so, because
there was not enough room. And in this bootless but
compact manner he passed his time.</p>

<p>The giant slept for three weeks at a time and two
days after he woke his breakfast was brought to him,
consisting of bright brown horses sprinkled on his bread
and butter. Besides his boots the giant had a pair of
shoes, and in one of them his wife lived when she was at
home: on other occasions she lived in the other shoe.
She was a sensible practical kind of woman, with two
wooden legs and a clothes-horse, but in other respects
not rich. The wooden legs were kept pointed at the
ends, in order that if the giant were dissatisfied with his
breakfast he might pick up any stray people that were
within reach, using his wife as a fork. This annoyed the
inhabitants of the district, so they built their church in
a south-westerly direction from the castle, behind the
giant’s back, that he might not be able to pick them
up as they went in. But those who stayed outside to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
play pitch-and-toss were exposed to great danger and
sufferings.</p>

<p>Now, in the village there were two brothers of altogether
different tastes and dispositions, and talents and
peculiarities and accomplishments, and in this way they
were discovered not to be the same person. The elder
of them was most marvellously good at singing and
could sing the Old Hundredth an old hundred times
without stopping. Whenever he did this he stood on
one leg and tied the other round his neck to avoid catching
cold and spoiling his voice; but the neighbours fled.
And he was also a rare hand at making guava dumplings
out of three cats and a shoehorn, which is an accomplishment
seldom met with. But his brother was a more
meagre magnanimous person, and his chief accomplishment
was to eat a wagon-load of hay overnight, and wake
up thatched in the morning.</p>

<p>The whole interest of this story depends upon the fact
that the giant’s wife’s clothes-horse broke in consequence
of a sudden thaw, being made of organ pipes. So she
took off her wooden legs and stuck them in the ground,
tying a string from the top of one to the top of the other,
and hung out her clothes to dry on that. Now this was
astutely remarked by the two brothers, who therefore
went up in front of the giant after he had his breakfast.
The giant called out “Fork! fork!” but his wife, trembling,
hid herself in the more recondite toe of the second
shoe. Then the singing brother began to sing: but he
had not taken into account the pious disposition of the
giant, who instantly joined in the psalm, and this caused
the singing brother to burst his head off, but, as it was
tied by the leg, he did not lose it altogether.</p>

<p>But the other brother, being well thatched on account
of the quantity of hay he had eaten overnight, lay down
between the great toe of the giant, and the next, and
wriggled. So the giant, being unable to bear tickling<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
in the feet, kicked out in an orthopodal manner: whereupon
the castle broke and he fell backwards, and was impaled
upon the sharp steeple of the church. So they put
a label on him on which was written “Nupides Giganteus.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Evangeline</span>,—<i>The Beguiler</i> is by
far the best magazine I ever read. I prefer it to
all others, and if I were allowed to get up I should
try it in my bath; but I can’t yet and therefore
have to be washed by a nurse. I never knew before
that flowers wielded such graceful pens and
the next time I go into the garden—which I hope
will be this year—I shall walk up and down the
borders with a new respect for them.</p>

<p><i>The Invalid’s Friend</i> has served its purpose
wonderfully. I have read it three times with
delight. It has made all its rivals on my table
here look very foolish—the <i>Nineteenth Century</i>
is conscious, beside it, of being too wordy, and
<i>Blackwood’s</i> of being without method, and the
<i>Cornhill</i> of coming out too often, with a vulgar
frequency, and the <i>Strand</i> of being too serious.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dearest of Aunts</span>,—Now you are up to
writing letters, I do wish you would send a line
to father to try and make him more reasonable.
He actually takes up the line that no girl should
marry under the age of twenty-one and then not
before she has known the man for a year. Just
think of being so out-of-date as that! And he
is so sensible in almost every other way, except
about ices.</p>

<p>There are some men of course who need time
for knowing, but Vincent is not one of them. I
feel that I have known him all my life, although
it is really only two months, but then he is so
simple and open. If he weren’t, he wouldn’t call
me his Sphinx, would he? For there is nothing

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Josey</span>,—I am sorry for all your
perplexities; but I can’t offer any help. Your
father probably knows best, but even if he doesn’t,
he must be considered too, because he is your father
and you are a child. Besides, I find myself
agreeing with what he says. Since you have asked
my advice you must listen to it, and my advice is
to obey your father and tell Vincent that you intend
to do so. Your father has been very understanding.
He has not forbidden you to see Vincent
at all, as many fathers would have done; he
has merely said that there are certain rules between
you and him which must be respected. I
think he is right, for two reasons. One because
it is his house and he must be the head of it, and
the other because you would be losing such a lot
of your young life if you had your way and married
now. Girls should be engaged; women married.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
To leave school and come into a world such
as yours and then miss all the fun of it between
your age and twenty-one, is to be very foolish.
It is throwing away a very delightful freedom.</p>

<p>Another thing—don’t you owe anything to
your father? You say that our first duty is to
ourselves. I am not sure that we can always separate
ourselves. Very often, and usually while
we are living under other people’s roofs and taking
other people’s money, we are not ourselves but
a blending of ourselves and themselves. Aren’t
you and your father a little bit mixed up like
that? Isn’t he entitled a little longer to the
company of the daughter he is so fond of? Think
about it from his point of view.—Your loving</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Field</span>,—By a most extraordinary

the desired country at that—Herefordshire, in
fact. He is a Bart’s contemporary and a very
old friend, and he not only needs a holiday but

I have secured him by holding you out

<span class="smcap">Horace Mun-Brown to Verena Raby</span></h2>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Aunt</span>,—You will remember my
failure to establish a business-man’s cinema in the
City. I may have been discouraged but I was not
dismayed, because I am convinced that there is
still an enormous field for picture palaces and
that the industry will increase rather than decay.
I have now hit upon another and more practicable
scheme and that is to build picture palaces just
inside the great London termini. The idea came
to me while waiting at Paddington the other day
after just missing my train. The next train was
not for two hours, and meanwhile I had nothing
to do. The thing to remember is that every day
crowds of people are in the same position as mine,
while there are countless others with time to kill
for different reasons. If a cinema theatre were
adjacent, with a continuous performance, it could
not but be a very popular boon and should pay
handsomely. Even the staff would probably often
steal a few minutes there; I don’t mean the station-master,
but certainly the porters, and the inhabitants<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
of the neighbourhood would come too.</p>

<p>All that is needed is to obtain permission from
the various Railway Companies to erect the buildings
on their premises and then collect the capital;
a mere trifle would be needed, because the site
would be either free, or negligibly cheap. If you
agree, would you invest, say, £1000 in it?</p>

<p>If I do not mention Hazel it is not because I
have ceased to love her, but because I have nothing
to report. I wish she could be got away from
her father, whose cynical influence is bad for her.
Detached, she might soon come to see things more
romantically and then would be my chance.—I
am, yours sincerely,</p>

<span class="smcap">Richard Haven to Verena Raby</span></h2>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">My Dear</span>, I am deeply interested in your desire
to spend money at once, while living. Personally,
I expect you do a great deal more with
it than you know, or at any rate than you led me
to understand. I happen to be acquainted with
your character.</p>

<p>The question is, are you strong enough to go<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>
into this matter?—for the best almsgiving, I take
it, is that which has not been asked, but comes
unexpectedly, dropping like gentle dew from a
clear sky; and this needs imagination and the
willingness to enter into all kinds of investigating
trouble. It is in essence the very antithesis of
facile cheque-writing; but so irksome, and unlocking
so much distress and squalor, that most of us
shy at it and reach for the cheque-book again in
self-defence. My friend Pagnell, who is all logic,
insists that philanthropists are of necessity busy-bodies,
and mischievously self-indulgent ones too,
and that the broken and the helpless should go to
the wall. That, he holds, is Nature’s plan, which
meddling man disturbs and frustrates. But the
English character is not sufficiently scientifically
de-sentimentalized for that.</p>

<p>One of the things that I should like to see done
with money is to reform education. This you
could easily do at a very trifling cost, at once,—and
have the fun of watching it go on—by endowing
certain experiments in your own village.
If they were successful there, their fame would be
noised abroad and others would copy and gradually
the seed would fructify. The smallness of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>
the seed never matters. The interest on a thousand
pounds would do it—fifty pounds a year to
an associate teacher whose duty it was to fit the
children for the world they are to live in. Reading,
writing and arithmetic would go on as usual,
but concurrently with them there would be instruction
in life: directed chiefly at the girls, who
are to be the wives and mothers and home upholders
of the future. If the hand that rocks the
cradle rules the world, the hand should be better
trained. One of the first things to be taught is
the amount of tea required in a tea-pot. The old
story about the wealth of mustard-makers being
derived from our wastefulness with their commodity
is probably far more true of the wealth of
tea-merchants.</p>

<p>The difficulty would be to find the teacher.
That always is the difficulty—finding the right
person to carry out one’s ideas. And, imagination
being the rarest quality in human nature, the
difficulty is not likely to decrease. The best way
would be to interest some cultured and well-to-do
resident to take it on—someone like your Mrs.
Carlyon—but, then you would be up against the
village schoolmaster, who, not having any imagination,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
would resent her rival influence, and so
the scheme would end where so many others
equally sensible have ended; in the realm where,
I am told, the battles of the future are to be
fought—in the air.</p>

<p>One of the reasons why progress is so piecemeal
is that the thinkers have to delegate, whereas
it is usually only the man that thought of a thing
who is really capable of carrying it out. We saw
enough of that in the War, where most of the
muddles and scandals were the result of delegation;
and most of them, for that reason, were unavoidable.</p>

<span class="smcap">Roy Barrance to Verena Raby</span></h2>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Aunt Verena</span>,—It is extraordinary how
things happen for the best, and I am sure that I
am being looked after by fate in some strange
particular way. I never have gone in much for
religion, but that there is a kind of guardian spirit<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span>
for people who behave decently I am convinced.
You remember about Trixie? Well, for quite a
long time I was heart-broken and couldn’t enjoy
food or anything. But I see now that it had to
happen, it was all done for my good, because it
gave me more depth and maturity so as to be
ready to meet Stella on level terms.</p>

<p>Stella is the loveliest girl you ever saw and
quite the best partner I have yet danced with,
almost my own height and so extraordinarily light
and supple without being too thin. She also has
a tremendous sense of humour, which I consider
most important in a perfect marriage. Lots of
marriages, I am convinced, have gone wrong because
the husband and wife had different ideas of
a joke. Poor mother, for instance, never sees that
father is pulling her leg, and it makes her querulous
where she ought to laugh.</p>

<p>I wish I could bring Stella to see you. She
sings divinely and can play all the latest things
by ear after hearing them only once; which is, I
think, a wonderful gift and makes her the life and
soul of parties. She would do you a world of
good. On a houseboat at Hampton last week-end
she never stopped. It was smashing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span></p>

<p>Her people are very well off, her father being
on the Stock Exchange. They live at Wimbledon
and have a full-sized table. Do write and send
me your congratulations. I have not seen her
father yet, but my idea is to make him take to
me so much that he finds a place for me in his
office. As there are no sons, he will probably
want someone to carry on the business and I
don’t doubt my ability to pick up the threads
very quickly. I wish it was Lloyd’s, because I
am told that is child’s play, but I don’t doubt I
could cut a figure on the Stock Exchange too.</p>

<p>Stella has a retroussé nose and the most adorable
smile. We have thousands of things in common,
besides a love of dancing. She says she
doesn’t want an engagement ring, she would
much rather have a deer-hound, so I am trying to
get one. I wonder if anybody breeds them in your
neighbourhood?</p>

<p>Father wants me to go to Oxford, just as if
there had been no War, but I don’t feel that I
could possibly endure the restrictions there. Besides,
what would Stella do? During the War
she worked too, for all kinds of Charities. She
was splendid. When you feel well enough, you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
must let me bring her down to play and sing to
you.—Your affectionate nephew,</p>

counsel, chiefly to nephews and nieces in whom
the fever of love burns or does not burn. Theodore’s
girl is the last—so very much a child of
the moment as to think that wanting a thing and
having it should be synonymous. I am feeling
very grateful I am not a mother and I felicitate
with you on your non-paternity. Parents just
now are anything but enviable. None the less....</p>

<p>It’s funny how the young people come to me

instead of a weary stationary horizontal middle-aged
female, whose only traffic in the emotions
occurred in the dim and distant past and is for
ever buried.—Good night,</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Serena</span>,—If I may call you again
by that name, which to me, in spite of everything,
is sacred still—I have only just had, from
my sister, the news of your illness, having in this
far spot few letters from home, and I write at
once to say that I am deeply grieved and hope
that already you are better.</p>

<p>If you can bring yourself to write, or to send
a message by another hand, I implore you to do
so. You may think it hard that it needed a
serious injury to occur to you before I wrote
again, but that would not necessarily convict me
of callousness. I swear to you, Serena, that not
a day has passed without my thinking of you—and
always with the tenderest devotion to you
and always with self-reproach and regret that, so
largely through my fault, or, even more, my own
impossible temperament, your life may have been
circumscribed and rendered less happy.</p>

<p>I know, through various channels, certain
things about your life to-day, but of course only<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
externals. I know, for instance, that you have
not married; but whether that is because of me
(as my own singleness is certainly associated with
you, or rather with us), I do not know. I know
by how many years you are my junior, and I am
forty-nine next week. If you are conscious of
loneliness and it is my influence that has kept
you from marrying, I am sorry; but there are
worse things than celibacy and it is probable
that both of us are best suited to that state. I
certainly am. The common notion that every
one ought to marry is as wrong-headed as that
every one ought to be an employer of labour.
Very few persons are really fitted to live
intimately with others; and the senseless heroic
way in which the effort is made or the compromise
sustained is among the chief of those
human tragedies which must most entertain the
ironical gods peering through the opera-glasses of
Heaven.</p>

<p>I must not suggest too much melancholy. I
don’t pretend that life has nothing in it but wistful
memories and regrets. On the contrary, I
taste many moments of pleasure. But—even
while enjoying my own somewhat anti-social nature—I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span>
should, were I asked to stand as fairy
godfather beside cradles, wish for no child a
sufficient income to indulge impulses, nor too emphatic
a desire to be sincere, nor, above all, any
hypertrophied fastidiousness. In a world constructed
not for units but for millions, such gifts
must necessarily isolate their possessor.</p>

<p>When the War broke out I was in Korea.
Since last we met I have been all over the world
and at the present moment am in Fez. I have
thousands of sketches stored away, some of which
might be worth showing, but I can’t bring myself
to the task of selection and all the other arrangements;
I can’t sometimes bear the thought that
anyone else should see them, so you will gather
that I am very little more reasonable than of old
and probably even less fitted to take a place in
the daily world.</p>

<p>If it would be any kind of pleasure to you to
see me—if I could help you in any way—you
have but to let me know. I shall be in Madrid,
at the Grand Hotel, till the end of next month
and will do as you tell me.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Verena</span>, to return to the great
money problem, I think you ought to know that
the papers print particulars of the will of a
Hastings innkeeper who set apart the interest on
£300 for an annual supper to sixty Hastings
newsboys. And a little while ago I cut from
the <i>Times</i> a will in which the testator, a fellmonger
and a gunner, killed during the War, left
“£1000 in trust during the life of his wife to
apply the income for a treat for the children of
the Chelsea and District Schools, Banstead, such
treat to consist of sweets, strawberries, or a visit
to the pantomime, and to be in the nature of a
surprise.”</p>

<p>Well, there would be no difficulty in arranging
for little things like that. All you want is a
good almoner and perhaps Miss Power would
take the post. And here again you could see
the fun going on, which the dead cannot. At least
we used to think they couldn’t, but the evidence
on the other side is accumulating. There is a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
conspiracy afoot to make us think that the dead
“carry on” too much as we do.</p>

<p>All you need is to ask yourself which kind
of worker is least rewarded, or you are most
sorry for, and go ahead. Lamb’s friend, James
White, would have chosen chimney-sweeps. The
late landlord of the Royal Oak at Hastings would
have replied “Newsboys.” Miss Rhoda Broughton
would reply, “Overworked horses.” On my
own list would occur railway porters. Also compositors.
And what about the little girls who
carry gentlemen’s new garments all about Savile
Row and the tailors’ quarters—is anything done
for them? And the window-cleaners—they can’t
have much fun. And oyster-openers—what a life!
And carpet-beaters—Heavens! And the little
telegraph girls, in couples, with the grubby hands.
No, the list would not be hard to compile.</p>

<p>There are possibilities of social regeneration in
it, too. Certain horrible imperfections—due to
haste and false economy and a want of thoroughness—are
allowed year after year to persist, to
the serious impairing of the nation’s nerves, which
might be removed, or at any rate reduced in
number, if some warm-hearted living hand, like<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
yours now, or wise dead hand, like yours in the
distant future, were outstretched. For example,
a legacy of a thousand pounds would not be
thrown away if the interest on it were offered
every year as a prize to the maker of chests-of-drawers
which would open most easily, or the
maker of looking-glasses which remained at the
desired angle without having to be wedged. The
details would have to be worked out, perhaps
through some furniture trade paper, but what a
heightening of effort and what a saving of temper
might result! And if a prize were offered to the
firm of haberdashers whose buttons were most
securely sewn on, what a wave of comfort might
be started! I bought some soft collars at a first-class
shop only last week and the buttons were
all loose and some of the button-holes were too
small; and it was I who suffered, not the haberdasher.
All he did was to spread his hands and
complain about post-war carelessness; whereas he
might just as well have supervised the things
before they were sent home as not. One of the
most infuriating things in Peace-time is the impossibility
of punishing anybody—except oneself.
The world is so prosperous that one can’t touch<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>
it. Once one could set a tradesman’s knees shaking
by merely expressing the intention of going
elsewhere in future; but it is so no longer.</p>

and then. I find that I can manage reading
aloud now with much less fatigue. Don’t you
think girls at school ought to be trained in it?</p>

<p>Did I tell you that my employer, Mr. Haven,
had a wonderful Solitaire board made on which
Miss Raby can play while lying at full length on
her back? The cards have holes in them at the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
top, and are hung on instead of being laid down,
as on a table. She is able to sit up better now and
can use a table, but she keeps this for times
when she is tired. Don’t you think it is the very
thing for Grannie? I think I shall get one made
and send it to her.</p>

<p>I have even taken on a class in the school—teaching
what is called daily sense. It is the idea
of my employer, Mr. Haven, and consists of
showing the little beggars how wrong it is, for
instance, to stand on the middle of the cane seat
of a chair, instead of on the wooden edges, and
things like that. The schoolmaster was very ratty
about it at first, but I did some of my blarneying
and now he’s a lamb.</p>

<p>It’s wonderful what an effect a little brogue has
on these Sassenachs. I noticed it among the
soldiers in France, officers and men, and it’s the
same here; and I swear I never really try. But
doesn’t it look as if all that poor old Ireland
needed to get her way was to send out an army
of Norahs and Bridgets just to talk and so convince?</p>

<p>Mr. Haven was here the other day. He is very
nice—tall, with very soft quite white hair, prematurely<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>
white. He did Miss Raby a world of
good—Your dutiful truant,</p>

</div>

<p>Well, the Great Day has nearly passed, and
Peace having now been formally celebrated we
must look out for squalls. I saw the procession
from a window, the owner of which—my old
friend Mrs. Kershaw—is paying her rent out of
the money she made by letting the rest of the
rooms. The caprice which decided that the route
should embrace her house she looks upon as a
direct answer to prayer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span></p>

<p>This reminds me of a true story, told me by
Mrs. Northgate-Grove, of their page-boy, who has
been very carefully brought up. At the local
Peace sports he was entered for the 100-yard
race, which, he said, would be an absolutely sure
thing for him, provided the telegraph boy didn’t
run. On the night before Peace Day, one of the
family passing his bedroom door heard him on his
knees imploring Divine interference. “O God, I
pray Thee that some important message may prevent
the telegraph boy from being able to compete.”
And here’s another nice prayer story. A
small girl was overheard by her mother asking God
to “Graciously make Rome the capital of Turkey.”
“But why do you pray for that, darling?” “Because
that’s how I put it in the examination paper
to-day.”</p>

<p>My head aches from this overture to the millennium
and I wish we were a year on. We
are settling down so perilously slowly. In fact,
here in London you would think it a perpetual
Bank Holiday, whereas never in our history ought
we to have been working harder than since the
Armistice. But who is to tell the people how
serious it all is? The statesmen’s “grave warnings”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>
and the newspapers’ constant chidings
equally are usually cancelled by parallel pages of
incitements to frivolity and expense. England,
for the greatest nation in the world, can be singularly
free from <i>esprit de corps</i>.</p>

<p>But these are gloomy Peace-Day reflections—possibly
due to the fact that it has begun to rain
and the fireworks will be spoiled. I am to see
them from a roof in Park Lane. I would much
rather spend the evening in the bosom of some
nice family and watch a baby being bathed and
put to bed. That is the prettiest sight in the
world; but I don’t know any babies any more.
Where are they all? Every one—particularly as
he gets older and more disposed to saturninity—should
know a baby and now and then see it
being put to bed.</p>

<p>Well, here goes for the fireworks.—Yours,</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Richard</span>,—The Peace Celebrations here,
they tell me, were very quiet. I am glad that
they are over at last and we can now all begin....</p>

<p>Your long letter about the benefactions has
given me plenty to think about for some days. I
had not thought of the distribution of money as
being so full of amusing possibilities: almost too
full. I should like to do something of the kind,
but to confine it to my own neighbourhood. But
then one’s name would be certain to leak out, and
it is so dreadful to be thanked.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, I wonder what you will think of
this idea. You remember Blanche Povey who
used to live at Pangbourne? She married a doctor,
a very nice man, Dr. Else, and they live at
Malvern. Malvern is of course a happy hunting
ground for medical men, because invalids<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span>
go there, mostly rich ones, and Dr. Else would
be doing very well, only for an infirmity. The
usual one—he drinks. Blanche tells me that he
is getting worse, and she sees nothing but disaster,
and every time he goes to a patient she fears he
may have over-stepped the mark and be found
out. It seems to me that if a man in his position,
a really nice man, could be promised anonymously
a good sum of money on the condition
that he did not touch alcohol for a year, much
good might be done. How does it strike you? Or
am I becoming that hateful thing, a busy-body?
With the best intentions, no doubt, but a busy-body
none the less.—Yours,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Aunt Verena</span>,—You must not think
I’m just a mere rotter when I tell you that Stella
and I have parted. I know it looks silly to be in
love with different girls so often, but then how is
one to discover which is the real one unless one
tries? Besides, at the time each is the only one. I
liked Stella in many ways and I like her still,
but I can see that we are not perfectly suited.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>
Her nature makes her pick up new friends, chiefly
men, too easily. My nature is not like that—I
want one and one only. Although of course all
this is Greek to you, perhaps you can sympathize.</p>

<p>Margot is much more like me and she shares
my keenness for the country. Stella hated being
away from London or excitement, while Margot
loves walking among the heather and all that sort
of thing. She knows a fearful lot about natural
history too, and only yesterday, when we were on
Box Hill, she corrected me when I said “There
goes a wood-pigeon” because it was really a ring-dove.
Pretty good, that, for a girl!</p>

<p>Don’t think I am flirting with her, because it
would be no use as she doesn’t intend ever to
marry, but I find her an A.1. pal and she is teaching
me lots of things and making me much more
observant. You would like her, I’m sure. Her
father is a retired brewer with oceans of Bradburies,
who wants her to marry a cousin.—Your

<p><span class="smcap">My Dear</span>, your question about the tippling
medico is not an easy one to answer. How
could he take money if he is a man with any
pride? The thing becomes a bribe, and bribes
are rather offensive. It is also on the cards that
what he needs to pull him together is not your
money, but just the jolt which expulsion from
Malvern would give him. He might then make
an effort and start afresh among patients who
are really ill and in need of a doctor—panel
work, for example. Somehow, I don’t like interference
in this kind of case. There is always
the chance, too, that teetotalism might make him
self-righteous and injure his character in other
ways, perhaps more undesirably than alcohol.
That’s how I feel.</p>

<p>On the other hand, expulsion from Malvern
might be the means of sending him wholly to the
devil. His self-respect would be lost and he
would sink lower and lower. In this case the
burden would fall chiefly on his wife, for with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>
the complete loss of self-respect there can come
to the loser a certain peace of mind; the struggle
is over; whereas she would suffer in two ways—through
grief and through poverty. There’s no
fairness in the world. The Gods may, as Edgar
says, be just in making of our pleasant vices whips
to scourge us, but there is no justice in including
the innocent in this castigation—as always happens.</p>

<p>Your best way is to be ready to do what you
can for the wife.</p>

<p>The League of Nations continues to engage
attention; but if I were building a house I should
build it underground. War can never be eliminated,
and it is certain in the future to be waged
chiefly in the air and without warning. It is
probably high time to turn our scaffold poles
into spades.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Richard</span>,—You were very good to reply
so quickly about poor Blanche’s husband. I wish
other people were as prompt and true to their
word. Dr. Else must now, I suppose, gang the
gait that the stars have prescribed for him; but
of course one has to remember that my interference
might be also in the stellar programme.</p>

<p>What I think I most want is advice as to the
disposition of money after I am dead. I suppose
I ought to be giving it to my own needy relations
while I am alive. There is poor Letitia, for one.
That husband of hers does nothing to add to his
pension, and I know she is in need of all kinds of
things. Roy is on my mind too. Not that his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>
father is not well off, but fathers and sons so
often fail to understand each other, and I feel
sure that the boy, if helped a little, might become
serious and develop into a self-supporting
man. At present he seems to do nothing but fall
in and out of love. I do not intend to blame
him for that, but I should like to see more stability.
He sends me the fullest account of his young
ladies, each of whom is perfect in turn. How
lovely to be young and absurd and not ashamed of
inconstancy! As we grow older we acquire such
stupid cautions.</p>

<span class="smcap">Richard Haven to Verena Raby</span></h2>

</div>

<p>Look here, Verena, I wish you wouldn’t say
fulsome things about my promptness and so forth.
My promptness is sheer self-indulgence, to prevent
the bore of accumulated correspondence. As for
my sagacity, don’t be so sure about it. You may
be taken in by my brevity and the confidence of
it all; and I may be utterly wrong about everything.
Why not?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span></p>

<p>Meanwhile, I have to remark that either everything
is in the stellar programme (as you so
happily call Fate) or nothing is. If your suggested
interference with the bibulous proclivities
of Dr. Else is written there, so is my dissuasion
of you.</p>

<p>If you are bent upon some form of corruption—bribing
people into Virtue—why not try it with
the young? There’s Roy, as you say, all ready
to be an ass. Might not he allow his life to be
regulated by the promise of “A Gift for a Good
Boy”? Not long ago some rich man left his
son a fortune on condition that he never approached
within a certain fixed distance—several
miles—of Piccadilly Circus. It got into the papers,
I remember. How it can be known whether
or not these conditions are observed I have no
notion. I trust it does not mean ceaseless tracking
by private detectives. But there is always a certain
fascination about them and I wonder that
dramatists have not done more with the idea.
Personally I think I hate such tampering with
destiny, fortunate or ill, but you must do as
you wish with your own. Besides, as I said before,
it is probably as much your fate to set up<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span>
obstacles to Roy’s folly as it is his to be foolish.
We only play at free will.</p>

<p>What is at the moment interesting me more
than such metaphysics is the problem: Where are
the scallops? Once upon a time there used to
be Coquilles St. Jacques twice a week, but my
faithful landlady can’t get scallops anywhere in
these days. Why do things suddenly disappear
like this? Is it because the scallop is a cheap
luxury, and the fishmonger wants to deal only in
the expensive articles? Whitechapel (that very
sensible country) is probably full of scallops.</p>

<p>Here’s another Chinese poem which gives me
great joy:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<span class="smcap">Roy Barrance to Verena Raby</span></h2>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Aunt Verena</span>,—Thank you for your
very kind letter, but really I don’t think I am in
any such danger as you seem to fear (and it’s
frightfully decent of you to take so much interest
in me and my affairs) because I always
feel that I am a kind of darling of the gods.
This must sound horribly conceited, but it isn’t
as bad as that really. It’s a kind of faith in a
higher protection, and there’s no harm in having
that, is there? Anyhow, it keeps me from getting
into anything like very serious trouble. I’ve just
had another example of this watchfulness, and
it’s so wonderful that I must tell you about it.</p>

<p>You remember about Stella and how glad we
were that it was all over with her? We shouldn’t
have suited each other a bit, and as a matter of
fact I think she would have dragged me down.
Well, after not seeing her for weeks, I ran into
her in Bond Street on Monday, and before I
knew where I was I’d asked her to dine at the
Elysian the next day. That was yesterday. It<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>
was foolish, I know, but she was so nice and
friendly in spite of it all, and looked rather pathetic,
and I always think one should be as kind
as possible—in fact I learnt it from you.</p>

<p>Anyway, I did it, and then went off and began
to regret it at once. I saw what an ass I
had been to re-open friendship with her. No
one should ever re-open with old flames, particularly
when they haven’t played the game. And
a meal is particularly unwise, because there may
be an extra glass of wine and then where are
you? You get soft and melting and forget what
you ought to remember, and all the fat is in the
fire once more, and before you know where you
are you are very likely engaged again. So I
went about kicking myself for being so gentle and
impulsive, and had a rotten night. The next day
I couldn’t telephone or wire to call it off, because
I hadn’t her address, and the wretched dinner
hung over me like the sword of what’s-his-name
all day. Some men of course wouldn’t have gone
at all, but I hate breaking engagements.</p>

<p>But—and this is the point—I needn’t have
worried at all; and after such a wonderful experience
of watchfulness over me I shall never<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span>
worry again—I should be a monster of ingratitude
if I did. Because all the time my guardian angel
was working for me. For when I had dressed
and started out to get to the Elysian punctually,
what do you think?—there was a cordon of police
all round it, to keep me and every one away, and
thousands of people looking on. The restaurant
had caught fire and was gradually but surely
burning to the ground! Wasn’t that an extraordinary
piece of luck, or rather, not luck but intervention?
Of course it was no good looking
for Stella among such a crowd, so I went off to
the Club and dined alone.</p>

<p>A religious fellow would make a tract about an
experience of this kind. I’m afraid I can’t be
called religious exactly, but I have learnt my
lesson.</p>

<p>I am still having bad nights thinking about
my future.—Your affectionate nephew,</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Aunt</span>,—As you know, there is great
need of a revival in all kinds of home industries
if we are to regain, or rather to hold, our place
among the nations, and I am far too keen a
political economist not to be giving much thought
to the matter. What I am at the moment most
interested in is the carpet manufacture. I have
heard of a firm in the West of England which
merely needs a little more capital to do the most
astonishing things, and I wonder if you would
advance me a thousand or so to invest in it. I
ask as a loan—no speculation at all.</p>

<p>One of the reasons why I have a leaning towards
this industry—apart from the fact that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span>
carpets must always be needed—is that the other
day when I was in the South Kensington Museum,
looking about for inspiration, I noticed an ancient
rug, hanging on the wall, which represented a
map. It at once struck me that it would be a
first-class notion to make map carpets for sale in
this country. Think of the enormous success
that a carpet-map of the Western Front would
have been during the late War. Conversation
need never have faltered, and if you had a real
soldier to tea or dinner he could have made his
story extraordinarily vivid by walking about the
room and illustrating the various positions. Or
take a carpet-map of Ireland—how that would
help in our understanding of the Irish question!
In nurseries too, the carpet could teach geography.
Children crawling over it from one country to another
could get a most astonishing notion of
boundaries and so forth.</p>

<p>The more I think of the scheme, the more I
am taken by it; and I hope, dear Aunt, that you

<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Friend and Philosopher</span>,—How
wise you are! On paper. When I meet you
and see your dear old face I know you are capable
of quite as many incautious impulses as
most of us; but when I read your cool counsels
and generalizations you seem to assume a white
beard of immense proportions and to be superior
to all human temptations or foibles.</p>

<p>Now, tell me, don’t you think there is any
way in which a little money might help to get
England back to a sense of orderliness and responsibility
again? Nesta and I have been wondering
if lecturers could be employed, perhaps
with cinema films, to excite people about England—the
idea of England as the country that
ought to set a good example, that always has
led and should lead again. A kind of pictorial
pageant of its greatness. Or there might be illustrated
lives of its greatest men, to stimulate<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span>
the ambition of the young and their parents.
It is all very vague in my mind, but don’t you
think there is something in it? The Rector,
I confess, is very cold. He says that what is
needed is more faith, more piety, and anything
that I could do to that end would be the best
thing of all; but when I ask him how, all he
can suggest is a new peal of bells here and a
handsome donation to the spire fund of the
church at Bournemouth where he was before he
came here, which was left unfinished. Nesta says
that, according to her recollection, Bournemouth
has too many spires as it is. I know you are usually
sarcastic about the Church, but do tell me
candidly what you think.</p>

<p>In exchange for all yours, I must give you
the last verse of a consolatory poem written for
me by a young sympathizer aged nine:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">How we watch the feeble flicker,</div>

    <div class="verse indent2">Soon she will be gone.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Apropos of children—Nesta’s Lobbie said a
rather nice thing the other day. There was
a wonderful sunset and she went out into the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span>
garden to see it. Then she said—“Mother, I
can’t think how God made the sky. I can understand
His making nuts”—here she rubbed her
thumb and finger together as though moulding
something—“and even flowers. But the sky—no!”—Your

<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Verena</span>, you have hurt me this
time. I never thought you had it in you to do
so, but you have. You tell me to tell you something
“candidly.” Now, when have I ever done
anything else?</p>

<p>As for the Church, I don’t think this the best
time to give it spires. It is not architecturally
that it needs help, and I never thought so with
more conviction than when, at a State banquet
the other night, to which I was bidden, I saw a
Bishop in purple evening dress. He looked an
astonishingly long way from Bethlehem.</p>

<p>As for the cinema scheme, it is ingenious and
might serve; but I think I should wait a little
until the present fermentation subsides. You<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span>
would never get a Picture Palace manager to put
it on now, when every one is thoughtless and
lavish with money and only excitement is popular.
I remember seeing an Italian cinema audience
go wild over a film about Mameli, who
wrote their national song and joined Garibaldi;
but that was just before a war—with Turkey—and
not after. Before a war you can do wonders
with people; but after—no. It is then that the
big men are needed.</p>

<p>I don’t often send you anything really wicked,
but the temptation to-day is too great to be
resisted. You are fond, I know, of those lines
by T. E. Brown called “My Garden.” Well, in
the magazine of Dartmouth Royal Naval College
some irreverent imp once wrote a parody which
I can no longer keep to myself. By what right
an embryonic admiral should also be a humorous
poet I can’t determine; but there is no logic in
life. Here is his mischief:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Verena</span>,—It is too long since I
wrote to you. The reason is that the trouble
about maids has been so constant and distressing.
I am sure that there could not be a house where
more consideration is shown, but we cannot get
any to stay. I don’t understand it in the least.
I have even offered to buy a gramophone for the
kitchen, but it is useless. I brought myself to
this step very reluctantly, because some of the
records with what I believe is called “patter” in
them are so vulgar, and too many of the songs
too. Our last cook stayed only four days and
vanished in the night. She seemed such a nice
woman, but you never can tell, they are so deceitful.
When we came down in the morning there
was a note on the kitchen table and no breakfast.
She had actually got out of the window
after we had gone to bed.</p>

<p>I now have one coming from the North with
an excellent character but she wants £45 a year.
Isn’t it monstrous? The housemaid has been here<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span>
for three weeks, but I wake several times every
night and fancy I hear her making off. Life
would be hardly worth living, under such circumstances,
but for our friends.</p>

<p>I hope your news is good. My own constant
ailment does not show any improvement and if
only I could feel any confidence about the house
I should go to Buxton. I heard from a visitor
at the Vicarage yesterday of another case of spinal
trouble which seems very like your own. That
too was the result of a fall. It was many years
ago and the poor sufferer is still helpless; but we
all hope better things for you.—Your sincerely

The Queen didn’t see the hole but you made me<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span>
cross by drawing attention to it and apologizing.
I said to the Queen, “I suppose you never wear
the same stockings again, Queen Mary,” and she
said, laughing, “Oh, yes, I do but you mustn’t
call me Queen Mary, you must call me Ma’am.”
Wasn’t it funny?</p>

<p><i>Dear Aunt Verena</i>,—I am feeling very run
down and depressed, because my star has set.
What I mean is that Margot has gone. Her
people have taken a place in Scotland and of
course she had to go too. As I believe I told
you, she never intends to marry, but all the
same she was a jolly good sort and we had some<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span>
topping walks together. We used to go to the
Zoo too, and as her father is a Fellow all the
keepers know her and show her the special things.
Being cooped up in London is rotten and I wondered
if I might come to you for a few days for
some country air and perhaps cheer you up a
bit. You must be very dull lying there all the
time with nothing but women about you. I
should be out most of the day, and I daresay there
are some people to play tennis with and a golf
course not too far off. Margot has been to Herefordshire
and she says it’s ripping, and what she
doesn’t know about the country isn’t worth knowing.
Of course if all this bores you, you’ll say
so, won’t you?—Your affectionate nephew,</p>

<span class="smcap">Richard Haven to Verena Raby</span></h2>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">My Dear</span>, I have to confess to a sad failure.
You must know that I am always hoping for an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span>
adventure that shall be worth narrating in a
letter to you, and sometimes I even strive for
them. My latest deliberate flirtation with the
Goddess of Chance occurred this afternoon; and
being deliberate it failed. At least there is
nothing in it for the immediate and sacred purpose:
but one never knows how long an arm
can be.</p>

<p>It happened this way. I had invited Anna—you
know, Fred Distyn’s sister—to a matinée;
and she was to meet me in the lobby five minutes
before the rise of the curtain. I was there
even earlier and stood waiting and watching the
eager faces of the arriving audience for fully ten
minutes after the play had begun. This eagerness
to be inside a theatre and witness rubbish is
(as you know) a terrible commentary on life and
the intellectual resources of civilization; but that
is beside the point.</p>

<p>Having waited for a quarter of an hour I then
deposited with the commissionaire a minutely-painted
word-portrait of Anna, together with her
ticket, and took my seat.</p>

<p>When the first Act was over and there was
still no Anna, I told the commissionaire to find<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span>
some one in the street who looked as though a
theatre would amuse him—or, if need be, her—and
invite him or her to occupy the empty place.</p>

<p>Now could one set a better trap for Fortune
than that?</p>

<p>But it was a hopeless fiasco. Instead of playing
the Haroun Al Raschid and going out into the
highways and byways, the commissionaire gave
the ticket to his wife, who happened to be calling
on him for some of his Saturday wages. My own
fault, of course, for I ought to have gone myself.
One should never delegate the privileges of romance.</p>

<p>Here is an old favourite, for a change:—</p>

heart-cell apart, and as fresh as yesterday. I am
not equal to the emotion of seeing you just yet,
nor am I sure that I want to. The you that I

young and ambitious and often masterful and yet
with such strange fits of misgiving. But I should

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">My Dear</span>, I hope that this heat isn’t too much
for you, but perhaps your circumambient heights
promote a breeze. London has been stifling. The
War has certainly broken down many of our old
conventions. Who, even in the hottest summer,
ever before saw bathing in the Trafalgar Square
fountains? Or stark naked boys careering round
Gordon’s statue. But I saw them to-day—a score
of them—with a policeman after them; for against
bathing there is a law to break, apparently. The
constable did not run, he merely advanced; but
they scampered before him, all gleaming in the
evening sun, dragging their scanty clothes behind
them, and those who were leading paused
now and then to get a leg into their trousers,
hesitated, failed, and were away again. It is
astonishing how little space can intervene between
what appears to be a sauntering policeman and
a naked fleeing boy. This constable was like
Fate.</p>

<p>I once read somewhere that clever women always<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span>
tell men that they look overworked. Yesterday
I made the discovery of a form of words
even more soothing when proceeding from feminine
lips: another weapon in the clever woman’s
verbal armoury—should she need any assistance
that way. The solicitous phrase “You are looking
overworked,” is unction perhaps more for the
young than the middle-aged and elderly. No
young man, however conscious of his own abysmal
laziness, can resist it, or want to resist it.
But the maturer man—the man to whom Father
Time’s chief gift is an increase of girth—must
be differently handled. He may be overworked,
but to be told about it, however seducingly, does
not much interest him. Besides he knows when
it is not true: when what looks like the effect of
overwork (supposing the lady to have something
to go upon) is really due to late hours or a glass
too many. In short, he is a little too old for any
flattery but the kind of flattery he is not too old
for. Therefore the clever woman, in dealing with
him, must do otherwise. Taking him by the
hand, she must look at his features with a close
and careful scrutiny which, although it is assumed,
can be extremely comforting, and then<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span>
say, in a tone almost of triumph, “You’re getting
thinner.”</p>

<p>Isn’t it about time that you sent me another
medical report? Here is a passage in Swift’s
letters that I hit upon last night:—</p>

<p>“And remember that riches are nine parts in
ten of all that is good in life, and health is the
tenth; drinking coffee comes long after, and yet
it is the eleventh; but without the two former,
you cannot drink it right.”</p>

<p>And here is to-day’s poem:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">If on a Spring night I went by</div>

<p>Who do you think wrote that? It is a very
fine specimen of what I call “Novelists’ poetry”—the
poetry which men known for their prose
and romance now and then produce. Most of them
occasionally try their hand, and often very interestingly.
One of the best short poems in the
language is an epitome of the life of man by
Eden Phillpotts. Grant Allen wrote some remarkable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span>
lines. The author of <i>The Children of
the Ghetto</i> has published a volume of his verses
which is full of arresting things. Thomas Hardy,
of course, has become poet altogether, and Maurice
Hewlett seems to be that way inclined. But still
I don’t tell you who wrote the lines just quoted:
John Galsworthy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Richard</span>,—I have come to the conclusion
that the immediate need is to get my will
properly fixed up. If you won’t accept the responsibility
of distributing money according to
your own judgment I must make some definite
bequests. I calculate that after relations and
friends and certain dependants are provided for
or remembered, there ought to be as much as
£50,000 to leave for some specific useful purpose.
It might go to build and endow alms-houses, it
might form a benevolent fund of some kind.
Please concentrate on this question, even though
it tends towards that pernicious evil “interference.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span></p>

<p>I am in momentary fear of losing Miss Power
because her mother has been ill; but hope for
the best. I don’t know what we should do without

<p>Now, Verena, you’re talking. The interest
on £50,000 at five per cent, with income-tax at
present rate deducted, would be, say, £1750.
Well, you can do lots of things with £1750 a
year.</p>

<p>Have you ever heard of the National Art
Collections Fund? This is a society of amateurs
of art who collect money in order to acquire for
the nation pictures and drawings and sculptures
which the nation ought not to miss but which it
has no official means of purchasing. For although
we have a National Gallery of the highest quality,
the Treasury grant for buying new masterpieces
for it is so small that, unless private enterprise
assists, everything goes to America. How would
you like your £1750 a year to assist the purchase<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span>
of pictures for the nation—whether hung in London
or elsewhere—for ever?</p>

<p>And then have you ever heard of the National
Trust for the Preservation of Places of Historic
Interest and Natural Beauty? This was founded
by the late Octavia Hill with the purpose of
acquiring for the nation, for ever, beauty spots
and open spaces and old comely buildings. Isn’t
that a good and humane idea? To preserve a
piece of grass land, with all its trees intact, in
the midst of a new building estate! All kinds
of parks and commons and hill-tops are now
inviolate through the activities of this Society.
Would you like your money to strengthen their
hands? No one with money to spare who followed
Octavia Hill could go wrong.</p>

<p>That is enough for the present; but I will
supply further hints.</p>

<p>You want stories, you say. Here is one which
was told yesterday, at Mrs. Beldham’s, by a very
attractive and humorous woman. We had been
talking of jewels; apropos, I think, of Lady
Crowborough’s pearl necklace which she took off
and allowed me to hold. Nothing more exquisite
than the temperature and texture of them could I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span>
imagine; only about twenty-five thousand pounds’
worth, that’s all. I wonder that the psychic
quality of jewels has not appealed more to novelists,
for there can be no doubt that they are
curiously sympathetic. Pearls in particular, which
grow the finer the more constantly and intimately
they are worn by congenial wearers, but which
languish and decline in lustre as their wearer loses
health, and worn on some necks refuse to glow
and shine at all. I can see a Hawthorney kind
of story in which the living pearls of a dead mistress
play a subtle part.</p>

<p>Anyway, we were talking about precious stones,
and this Mrs. Dee told us her hard case. For she
is the owner of some of the most beautiful emeralds
that exist in this country: the owner, but
she cannot get at them. They belonged, she said,
to her Aunt Emily, and it was always understood
that upon the death of that estimable and ageing
lady they were to descend to her. It was, indeed,
in the will. And so they would have done, had
not the too officious layers-out neglected to remove
them from the old lady’s neck.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Best of Beans</span>,—I am having quite a good
time here, after all. One of the carriage horses
isn’t at all a bad hack and there’s some ripping
country. At the end of Hargest Ridge there’s
an old race-course which hasn’t been used for
centuries, where you can gallop for miles. Aunt
Verena looks perfectly fit but she has to keep still.
She is awfully decent to me and really wants to
set me on my feet. Why is it that Aunts and
Uncles can be so much jollier and more sympathetic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span>
than fond parents? One of Nesta’s kids
is here too—Lobbie—and we have a great rag
every bed-time. Aunt Verena doesn’t seem to
think that I am cut out for the Diplomatic Service.
Perhaps not. Personally I should prefer to
manage an estate. If it comes to the worst, there’s
always the stage, but after the Stella incident the
very thought of singing musical-comedy songs
makes me shudder. There’s rather a nice Irish
girl here, who reads to Aunt Verena, named Clemency
Power. She was in a canteen in France during
the War. I never met a Clemency before.
She’s got a heavenly touch of brogue.</p>

<p>Tell me all about things and how the home-barometer
reads. Is it still “Stormy”?—Yours

<p><span class="smcap">My Dear</span>, with a view to getting assistance
towards the solution of the great testamentary
problem, I went yesterday to see Bemerton the
bookseller and inquire about the literature of charity<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span>
(for, as that witty cleric, the late Dean Beeching,
wrote:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">It all comes out of the books I read</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And it all goes into the books I write</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">—or, more accurately, the letters I write, for I
have never touched authorship proper) and he
produced from those inexhaustible shelves a report
on alms-houses and kindred endowments published
in 1829 under the title <i>The Endowed Charities
of the City of London</i>. This exceedingly
formidable tome I am going to peruse and send
you the results; and really I don’t think I could
do a more disinterested thing, for none of your
money is coming to me, and it consists of nearly
eight-hundred double-column pages of the kind
of small type into which the Editor of the <i>Times</i>
puts the letters of the most insignificant of his
correspondents.</p>

<p>Bemerton, by the way, told me a very nice ghost
story which, when I can find an hour or two, I
am going to write out for you. It was told him
by a distinguished Orientalist, and he believes it
and I should like to.</p>

<p>There’s a threat of Prohibition coming to England
too, but I hope against it. There is too much<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span>
of “Thou shalt not” in the world. If people
were trusted more, there would probably be less
excess and folly. So far as I can gather from
those who know America, one effect—and by no
means a desirable one—of the dry enactment is
to increase trickery and mendacity. The illicit
sale of alcoholic beverages still goes on, but as
it is illegal it must be done secretly and lies must
be told to cover it. Personally I would rather
think of a nation too convivially merry than of
one systematically deceptive.</p>

<p>Omar should be arrayed against Prohibition at
once:</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">And if a curse, why then Who set it there?</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">—that wants some answering. All the same,
there are probably more people who would be
better for less drink than those who would be
improved by more; but the second class exists.
I have met several of them.</p>

<p>One of the best commentaries on abstinence by
compulsion is that of Walter Raleigh, the Professor
of Literature. During the War there was
a movement at Oxford to prevent Freshers’ Wines
and keep all intoxicants out of the Colleges; and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span>
a petition to the Vice-Chancellor to this effect was
signed by a large number of persons, chiefly in
Holy Orders. Walter Raleigh, however, wouldn’t
sign it, and this is part of the letter in which he
gave his reasons:—</p>

<p>“I cannot think it wise to ask the resident members
of the University to adopt rules drafted for
them by a body of petitioners the bulk of whom
are neither responsible for the discipline of the
Colleges nor well acquainted with the life of the
undergraduates.</p>

<p>“A certain amount of freedom to go wrong is
essential in a University, where men are learning,
not to obey, but to choose.</p>

<p>“Thousands of the men whose habits you censure
have already died for their people and country.
Virtually all have fought. Why is it, that
when the greatest mystery of the Christian religion
comes alive again before our eyes, so many
of the authorized teachers of Christianity do not
see it or understand it, but retire to the timid
security of a prohibitive and negative virtue?
Your petition is an insult to the men who have
saved you and are saving you.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My Dearest Serena</span>,—I am sending a selection,

adopt the Japanese custom and change them periodically.
The Japanese make each picture the
King of the Wall for a week or so in turn, but
I should like you to have a fresh one of my drawings
on the easel every day—for the whole day.
That is, of course, if you like them. I cannot tell
you how happy I am to be allowed to do this. I
feel that I am again in your life, but with perfect
safety: vicariously, so to speak, but with the fullest
fidelity too. Let some one advise me of safe
arrival. I am sending you sixty picked things—so
you must be well again in sixty days! But I
daresay that if you did the picking you would
make a totally different choice. One of the tragic
things in an artist’s life—and I don’t mean by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span>

admire what he thinks his least worthy efforts.</p>

<span class="smcap">Richard Haven to Verena Raby</span></h2>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Verena</span>, I now send you some notes collected
from the perusal of the gigantic volume on
the Endowed Charities of London as they were
examined by a commission early in the last century.
It is a monument to the public-spirited
dead. In London the benefactions run chiefly to
free schools, alms-houses, subsidized sermons and
doles of bread and coal—“sea coal,” as it is
usually called. Now and then there is an original
touch, as when one Gilbert Keate gave to the
parish of St. Dunstan’s in the East—you know,
the church with the lovely spire built on flying
buttresses—“£60, to be lent gratis, yearly, during
the space of four years, to three young men inhabitants
of this parish (one of them to be of the
Dolphin precinct), by the vestry, to each £20 on
good security, by bond for repayment at four
years’ end, as the inhabitants in vestry should
think fit.”</p>

<p>Samuel Wilson did even better, his will, dated
October 27th, 1766, containing this clause: “And<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span>
my mind and will further is, that the said sum of
twenty thousand pounds, or whatever sum be so
paid by my said executors to the said chamberlain,
shall be and remain as a perpetual fund, to be
lent to young men who have been set up one year,
or not more than two years, in some trade or manufacture,
in the city of London, or within three
miles thereof, and can give satisfactory security
for the repayment of the money so lent to them;
... and further my mind and will is, that no
part of this money shall be lent to an alehouse
keeper, a distiller or vendor of distilled liquors.”</p>

<p>That seems to me to be a very excellent disposition
of money; but probably it is not in your
line. The Corporation of London was appointed
to manage the charity, but as a rule these rich
City men left their money to their Chartered Companies
for distribution. Where alms-houses, for
example, are built and endowed there must obviously
be some organization to carry them on;
and the City Companies, who are commonly supposed
to devote their time to eating and drinking,
really exist largely for this admirable purpose.
So do churchwardens; carrying round the plate
is but a small part of their duties.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span></p>

<p>Here is a pretty compliment, to take the taste
of all that away:—</p>

<p>A letter from an old friend making his first

Nothing could be more beautiful than the
views of water and sky, and now and then of
scenery or buildings, that I have been getting
through my porthole. I would almost go so far
as to say that round pictures are the only ones—at
any rate of the open air. You should get one
of the Galleries to arrange a Porthole Exhibition
and start the fashion.”—Good night,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Aunt Verena</span>,—Since Roy has come
back from his visit, I seem to know so much more
about you. I don’t mean that he tells us anything,
but he answers questions. I want to thank
you for your kindness to him, which was just what
he was needing to pull him together, because father
never has time to take any real interest in
him and is impatient too. Fathers and sons so
often, it seems to me, are the last people who
ought to meet. Mothers and daughters can hit it
off badly enough and misunderstand each other
thoroughly, but I don’t think there is so much real
hostility between them as between those others.
I don’t think hostility is the word; it is a kind
of rivalry, particularly as the mother usually takes
the boy’s side. Anyway, if you are going to be
as much interested in poor old Roy as he says, I
am sure he will buck up and do something worth
while, because he has lots of ability and makes
friends too. In fact, when it comes to the other
sex he makes them too easily. His chief trouble<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span>
is that he had just enough Army life to unsettle
him and not enough to give him discipline. The
War came for him at the wrong time: he ought
to have been younger and escaped it or older and
have gone properly into it.</p>

<p>I was much more lucky, for I shall never regret
a moment of my V.A.D. work. But I wish I
could be busy again. So does nearly every girl
I know. We all miss the War horribly; which
sounds a callous and selfish thing to say, but isn’t
really. It shows, however, that there must be
something very wrong with our civilization if it
needs a ghastly thing like that to give thousands
and thousands of girls their only chance to be
useful!—Your loving</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Verena</span>, I return to the Charity Book.
Behold the case of Peter Symonds, which may,
or may not, offer suggestions. “Peter Symonds,
by will, dated 4th April, 1586, gave to the parson
and churchwardens of All Saints, Lombard Street,
yearly, for ever, £3, 2s. 8d., to be received of the
churchwardens and socialty of the Company of
Mercers, to be employed by the said parson and
churchwardens in manner following, viz. to pay
30s. thereof yearly, on Good Friday, to the children
of Christ’s Hospital, in London, on condition
that the same children, or threescore of them
at least, should, on the same Good Friday, in the
morning, yearly, for ever, come into the said
church of All Saints ... and he directed that the
said parson and churchwardens should bestow 3s.
4d. in the purchase of good raisins, which should
be divided in threescore parts, in paper, and one
part given to each child; and he gave 16d. of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span>
said £3, 2s. 8d. to the beadles of the hospital,
who should come with the children.”</p>

<p>Peter Symonds was a man, and perhaps you
would rather be guided by a woman. If so, observe
the example of Margaret Sharles:—</p>

<p>“By will, dated 2nd September, 1600, Margaret
Sharles bequeathed £20 unto such a learned
man as her overseers should think good, to preach
every week in the year, in the parish of Christ
Church ... she also bequeathed to the vicar and
churchwardens, £5 a year, to be employed for
ever, towards the relief of the vicar, curate, clerk,
and sexton by the discretion of the churchwardens
there; she also gave unto and amongst her
poor tenants within the said parish, £6 yearly,
for ever, to be bestowed in manner following: £1,
6s. 8d. for a load of great coals; 16s. for a thousand
billets, to be distributed amongst her said
tenants, three days before Christmas, and the residue
thereof to be spent upon a dinner for her
said poor tenants on Christmas Day, at the sign
of the Bell, in Newgate-market.”</p>

<p>Even better, for your purpose, is the example
of Jane Shank:—</p>

<p>“By will, dated 7th July, 1795, Mrs. Jane<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span>
Shank directed that the Painter-stainers’ Company
should divide the interest on her fortune into
twelve equal parts, and shall apply eleven-twelfth
parts thereof in payment of pensions of £10 a
year, to indigent blind women, and retain the remaining
twelfth part as a compensation for their
trouble and expenses. Jane Shank requested that
the Company would advertise for proper objects
of the charity in two morning and two evening
papers, three times each, as often as any vacancies
should happen; and she directed that the persons
to be elected should be of the age of 61 years at
the least, should have been blind three years,
should be widows or unmarried, and unable to
maintain themselves by any employment, should
be in distressed circumstances, born in England,
not in Wales or Ireland, have lived three years
in their present parish, have no income for life
above £10 a year, never having received alms of
any parish or place, never having been a common
beggar, and being of sober life and conversation.”</p>

<p>Jane, you see, was a forerunner of Sir Arthur
Pearson of St. Dunstan’s, who would, I am sure,
have no difficulty in recommending a suitable destination
for any spare funds of your own.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span></p>

<p>But I must not weary you (or myself) with
these testaments.</p>

<p>Here is a story that was told by my friend, Mrs.
Torwood Leigh. Towards the end of the War
she gave a party to an Officers’ mess stationed in
the neighbourhood, and almost every guest exceeded.
The next day, when they called to return
thanks, each one in turn took her aside to
apologize—for another!</p>

it is a charming idea and will make the

me as a business man and nothing else, even although
so many of my schemes have come to nothing.
But I assure you I am quite human too and
often think of your illness with sincere regret. If
I have had bad luck with my schemes, it is due to
the fact, which is no disgrace, that they are before
their time. I have been, in a way, too far-sighted.
I have seen the public needs too soon, before even
the public is conscious of them; which commercially
is a mistake. One cannot, however, change
one’s nature. My great distress is that I have as
yet failed to convince you of my general acuteness,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203"></a>[203]</span>
at any rate to the point of support. Without
a little capital a young experimentalist can
do nothing, and I have only my brains.</p>

<p>The project which I am now about to lay before
you is, however, so different from the others,
and so romantic and picturesque, that I feel sure
you will be interested. It also offers chances of
rich returns.</p>

<p>There is somewhere in Mexico a lake with
which is associated a very remarkable religious
ceremony. On a certain day in the year the priest
of the community, accompanied by thousands of
worshippers, proceeds to the shore of this lake,
where, after some impressive rites, he enters the
water. The others remain outside. The priest
wades steadily out into the lake, the bottom of
which slopes very gradually, until his head alone
is visible.</p>

<p>(All this may sound very odd to you, but you
must remember, dear Aunt, that the Mexicans are
a strange race and that foreign religions can often
appear grotesque to us. My informant, a very
cultivated man, assures me that, in this lake business,
the comic element is lacking, such is the fervour
of the multitude.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span></p>

<p>Very well then, the priest, having reached the
farthest point, remains standing there while the
people set to work to tear off their jewels and
ornaments, which were brought for the purpose,
and to fling them at him. The idea is that if the
article thrown reaches him or goes beyond him,
the thrower’s sins are forgiven. <i>But the point for
you and me is that whether you throw far or
throw short, the jewels and ornaments fall into
the water and sink.</i></p>

<p>Now this has been going on for ages, and since
it would be impious for the Mexican believers to
attempt to recover any of the treasure it follows
that it is there still. My plan is very simple—merely
to form a small company and to drain the
lake. I can give you no particulars at the moment—I
have not even ascertained how big the
lake is—but I am being very active about it and
am already on the track of a first-class engineer.
As he, however, requires a financial guarantee, I
am hoping that you will see your way to invest,
say, £1000 at once and perhaps more later.—I
am, your affectionate nephew,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Miss Power</span>,—I hope you won’t think
it awful cheek of me to write to you but you
were saying the other day that you wondered if
it was necessary to get a passport to go to Ireland
now. I thought you would like to know that it
isn’t. I inquired about it at Cook’s. But I hope
you are not going home just yet, for I am sure
my aunt can’t spare you. I wish all the same that
when you do go I could be there, for Ireland is
one of the places I have always wanted to see,
and I have always felt that the only decent thing
to do is to give them Home Rule and have done
with it. A fellow I know in the Air Force who

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Barrance</span>,—It was very kind of
you to trouble about the passport. I hope not to
be leaving Miss Raby until she has really done
with me, but my Mother, who lives near Kenmare,
is sometimes not very well and I might be sent for
and should not like to have to be delayed by red
tape. Yes, Kerry is very lovely and I find myself
longing for it most of the time. But I doubt
if you would care for a country that is so wet.
English people are so often disappointed to find
only grey mists and rain. For fine weather June
is the best month in our parts, but I like it all—grey
mists and rain hardly less than the sunshine.
Lobbie has been very naughty since you left and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[208]</span>
goes to bed in the dumps instead of in the highest
spirits. I am reading Miss Raby the loveliest
Irish book—indade and it’s more than that, it’s
a Kerry book—just now, called <i>Mary of the

go on at all at all. It’s destroyed I am with the

Irish blood in our family, some way back, and I
always feel drawn to the Irish and sorry for them.
As for wet weather I love it when I’m prepared
for it; and I’ve got a topping Burberry. I got
that book you mentioned, <i>Mary of the Winds</i>,
but it’s a little off my beat. I would give anything
to hear you read it, it would be just too
lovely, and better than any music. I hope you
don’t mind my saying that I think your ordinary
voice absolutely top-hole, the most ripping thing I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[209]</span>
ever listened to. There isn’t any music, not even
“You’re here and I’m here,” to touch it. Most

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Verena</span>, you ought perhaps to know
about the St. Ethelburga Society School, where
36 boys and 20 girls were educated, and fully
re-clothed once a year—being taught reading,
writing and arithmetic and the catechism, with
Lewis’s explanation—and all for £1400 permanent
funds and occasional subscriptions and donations.
But of course money was worth more
then than in our reckless post-War day. For example,
at the St. Bride’s School 80 boys and 70
girls were educated, of whom 40 boys and 30
girls were also clothed and apprentice fees of £3
given with certain of the boys—and this on an income
of £375.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span></p>

<p>I have long thought that a handbook should
be compiled for the benefit of persons, like yourself,
who are philanthropically disposed but don’t
know what to do. It might have some such title
as “Philanthropic Hints to Those about to Make
their Wills,” or “The Inspired Testator,” or
“First Aid to Imaginative Bequest” or “The Prudent
Lawyer Confounded” or “How to be Happy
though Dead.” In this book an alphabetical list
would be given of the less fortunate ones of the
earth and suggestions offered as to what a little
money could do towards a periodic gilding of their
existence. No one could compile it without the
assistance of my London Charity report or similar
works.</p>

<p>For a change let me give you a poem in prose:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center">FATHER-LOVE</p>

<p class="hanging">One hears so much of mother-love.</p>

<p class="hanging">The phrase alone is expected to touch the very springs
of emotion.</p>

<p class="hanging">There are songs about it, set to maudlin music; there is,
in America, a Mother’s Day.</p>

<p class="hanging">The stronger the bonds that unite mothers and children
the better for human society;</p>

<p class="hanging">The more we think of and cherish our mothers the better

<p class="hanging">We owe so much tenderness to them not merely because
they gave us life, but because they are women and
as such have a disproportionate burden of drudgery

<p class="hanging">All the same, why was it that when, the other evening, I
saw a grey-haired father—my host—thinking himself
unobserved, stroke the head of his grown-up son
(a father too) and the son lay his hand on his
father’s with a caressing gesture for a moment, but
with a slightly guilty look—why was it that something
melted within me (as it never does when I
watch the embraces of mothers and sons) and my
eyes suddenly dimmed?</p>

<span class="smcap">Louisa Parrish to Verena Raby</span></h2>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Verena</span>,—I have just returned from
the funeral of my brother Claude, one of the most
beautiful interments I was ever privileged to attend.
With great forethought he had himself
selected the site when the cemetery was first laid<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212"></a>[212]</span>
out, choosing a spot between two lovely firs on
the high ground where the view is so extensive.
He always was so careful in his ways, and this is
but another example of his kindly consideration
for others. By the blessing of Heaven the day
was fine, but the mourners were protected from
the sun by the grateful shade of the trees—exactly,
I feel sure, as my dear brother had planned.
Now and then, when I was able to raise my eyes,
there lay the wonderful panorama before me.</p>

<p>The funeral attracted a large concourse, Claude
having been a public man held in the greatest
esteem and affection, and there were few dry eyes.
The coffin was very plain, for he always held that
it was a waste of money to spend it lavishly on
the trappings of mortality.</p>

<p>Forgive me if I write no more this evening,
for I am tired with travelling and sad at heart.

<h3>THE TEST<br />
A STORY</h3>

<p>There was once a girl named Philippa Barnes whose
father and mother died when she was seventeen. As
she was too young to be married and was very rich, she
had to have a guardian, and in reply to an advertisement<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[216]</span>
a number of candidates for that position came forward.
They were all handsome elderly men of nearly forty, and
when Philippa saw them she liked most of them a good
deal, but as their references were all perfect she was
puzzled how to choose. Being very fond of Shakespeare
she had read <i>The Merchant of Venice</i> and she decided
that she must devise a test, as Portia did, but as it would
be foolish to borrow the idea of the three caskets, which
most people know about, she had to invent a new one.</p>

<p>All the applicants for the post of guardian were told
to be at her family mansion at ten o’clock in the morning,
and when they were assembled Philippa sent for them
one by one and told each that he must recount to her
some anecdote in which he had taken part with some
person of inferior position—such as a bus-conductor or
a taxi-driver or a railway porter or a waiter or a char.
When they had all finished Philippa made her choice,
which fell upon a candidate named Barclay Pole who
was not so tall as the others and not so well dressed,
although his references were beyond dispute.</p>

<p>“But,” said her old nurse, who had been standing by
her side all through the interviews, “why do you choose
him when there are all those handsome ones at your
disposal?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[217]</span></p>

<p>“Because,” Philippa said, “he was the only one who
when he told the story did not make the other person
call him Sir.”</p>

<p>Barclay Pole thus became her guardian and carried
out his duties with perfect success until it was time to
give her hand in marriage to Captain Knightliville of
the Guards.</p>

<h3>PEOPLE WHO REALLY DESERVE THE O.B.E.</h3>

<h4>II. THE POSTMAN</h4>

<p>When my brother was small he wanted to be a postman
because he wanted to knock double knocks; but no one
who is grown up would want it, because there is no fun
in spending your life in delivering letters to other people,
other people’s letters are so dull.</p>

<p>Other people have such odd ways with their letters.
Father even is cross when there is a letter for him and
says “Confound the thing!—why can’t they leave me
alone?” But my eldest sister waits for the postman and
is miserable if he doesn’t bring her anything.</p>

<p>Some people lay their letters by their plates and go on
eating. This seems to me extraordinary.</p>

<p>Some of our visitors who get letters say “Excuse me”
before they read them, but others don’t.</p>

<p>When I think of the postman going on for ever and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218"></a>[218]</span>
ever taking letters to other people I am convinced that
he ought to have the O.B.E.</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Rose</span>”</p>

<hr />

<h3>THE CINEMA</h3>

<p>One of the strange things to reflect about is what people
did before the cinema was invented. My father was an
old man before he ever saw a moving picture and when
he was a boy there were none. He does not like them
now because he says he always comes away with either
a headache or a flea, but I like them excessively.</p>

<p>I like the serious ones best, but my brother Jack wants
the comic ones. He can walk like Charlie Chaplin.
He likes Mutt and Jeff too. I know a girl who was
photographed by a cinema man while she was at Church
Parade in the Park and the next week she saw it at a
Picture Palace and recognized herself.</p>

<p>One kind of a film is always very dull and that is the
kind that shows the King shaking hands with the Lord
Mayor and people coming away from football matches.
It is a very curious thing but nearly always when I get
into a cinema this kind of film happens at once and goes
on for a long time, so that it is very often too late to stay
to the end of the story-film.</p>

<p>I wish they would turn more books into films. A
girl I know lived in Paris and saw <i>The Count of Monte
Cristo</i> and it was splendid. Lots of books would make
good films. The other day we all said what books we
would most like to see on the movies. Two girls came
to tea and one said <i>The Black Tulip</i> and the other <i>Little
Women</i>. Jack wanted <i>Twenty Thousand Leagues under<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219"></a>[219]</span>
the Sea</i> and I think one of Mrs. Nesbit’s books like
<i>The Enchanted Castle</i> would be splendid.</p>

<p>One thing that I don’t like about the movies is that
they give you too much time to read the short sentences in.</p>

<p>It is funny how a high wind always blows in American
drawing-rooms in the cinema.</p>

<p>M.P.s when you see them on the movies going to the
opening of Parliament always walk too fast.</p>

<h3>A VISIT TO THE ZOO</h3>

<p>Last Saturday we all went to the Zoo. There were no
lion or tiger cubs, but we went behind the cages in the
reptile house and the keeper showed us some baby crocodiles
and let us hold one. It had the funniest little
teeth like a tiny saw, and a white throat which it can
close up in the water, and a film comes over its eyes
when it likes just like the shutter of a Brownie. The
keeper said it was a few months old but would very
likely live to be a hundred.</p>

<p>Then he hooked a boa constrictor out of its cage and
asked us to hold it. I was frightened at first but after
Jack and the others had held it I tried. Its body feels
terribly strong and electric and all the time it is coiling
about and darting out a little forked tongue. I was very
glad when the keeper took it away.</p>

<p>We saw the diving birds being fed in their tank.
There are two of them, one in a cage at each end, and
the keeper throws little live fish into the tank and lets
out one bird at a time. At first we were very sorry for
the poor little fish, which swim about frantically in all
directions to escape from the terrible great bird who
dashes after them like a cruel submarine; but after a
while we began to want the bird not to miss any. Isn’t
that funny? And my brother Jack got so excited that
he pointed out to the bird where one of the little fish
was hiding and cried out “Here he is, look, down here!
Look, in the corner!”</p>

<h3>A FABLE</h3>

<p>There was once a garden path paved with flat stones,
and in between the stones were little tufts of thyme and
other herbs.</p>

<p>On each side of the path were beds full of gay flowers,
among which was a very vain geranium, who, when no
one was about, used to mock the thyme because it was
in such an exposed spot and liable to be walked on.</p>

<p>“The proper place for plants,” the geranium said, “is
in a bed where they are safe from people’s feet and are
treated with respect. Look at me!”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the thyme, “but the more I am trampled
on the sweeter I become and the more the lady who
planted me likes me. Haven’t you seen her squeezing
me with her beautiful hands and then inhaling my
fragrance, whereas if anything hits you you are done for
for ever.”</p>

<p>And at that moment a tennis ball, struck out of the
court near by, fell on the geranium and broke it in two.</p>

<p>The moral is that every one has his own place in life
and we should mind our own business.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Editor</span>,—Having read your second
number I feel so much better that I am confident—to
my distress—that a third will not be needed.
And yet I should so much like to read many more.
I have been moved to become a poet myself and
write you a testimonial. After hours of thought
in the watches of the night I produced this couplet,
which even though it is not worthy to stand
beside Pansy’s historical ballads is sincere:—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Richard</span>,—I am rather upset by a piece
of news this morning. Dr. Ferguson came in to
say that he is going away next week for a month’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"></a>[226]</span>
holiday, and I can quite believe that he needs
one, for I alone must have been a great source of
anxiety to him—but it was rather a shock. He
went on to say that he has found a very good
<i>locum</i>; but none the less I am terrified. I can’t
bear the thought of a stranger.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear “Uncle,”</span>—Aunt Verena has got it into
her head that the <i>locum</i> who is coming next week
to take Dr. Ferguson’s place will not understand
her case and she is working herself into a fret
over it. Dr. Ferguson assures me that he
wouldn’t allow anyone to take his place who is
not qualified in every way, and he says too that
Aunt Verena ought for every reason to be placid.
Do please write to her to help soothe her down

<p><span class="smcap">Dearest Verena</span>, I quite understand your
nervousness about this new doctor, but I think you
should be more of a gambler over it all. You
should be more trustful of your star, which,
though it (to my mind, very reprehensively), allowed
you to have a horrid fall, has made things
as comfortable as possible since. Until I hear to
the contrary I intend to think of the new doctor
as a godsend, and a very agreeable change to old
Ferguson, who struck me as a prosy dog. Be an
optimist, my dear.</p>

<p>The more I think of your money and your character,
the more I incline towards alms-houses,
which, in a human non-Nietzschean country like
ours, I consider to be among the most satisfactory
forms of sheer benevolence. But I am not wholly
convinced, and I should hate to see the interest on
£50,000 going in any way astray. Meanwhile I
have made notes on the alms-houses in this book.
But what perplexes me is that these benevolent
people wait till they are dead. It would be far<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[228]</span>
more fun to have alms-houses while one was alive
and watch them at work.</p>

<p>Here is an essay on the death of an imaginary
grandmother which little Mary Landseer has produced.
The death of one’s grandmother had been
set, by an almost too whimsical instructress, as
the subject of a composition:—</p>

<p>“One day, I think it was the hapiest day in the
world for me. My Granmother died and left
me £50. Without waiting to morn or wait for
her funral I was walking along Oxford St. in
surch of things to buy. My heart was as light as
a feather as I walked and my boots were up in
the ere.</p>

<p>“First I thought of what my Husband would
like me to have, then with a suden thought I
turned my steps home-would, and that night I
went to a play, the next a nother, and so I went
on till I had only 10s. left. Then how I wished
my other Granmother was died, but it was no
good. And when I had children I wished I had
not been so rash as to spend it on abusments, but
had saved it, but it was gone for ever and my
other Granmother never died, to my grat misfortune.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[229]</span></p>

<p>It was Mary’s father who wrote that exquisite
thing to a Vicereine in India. “I wash your feet
with my hair,” he said at the end of a letter, employing
an Indian phrase of courtesy, adding, “It
is true that I have very little hair, but then you
have very little feet.”</p>

<p>Behold the punctual poem:—</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Madam</span>,—This is to let you know with
my respects that the children are quite well and
happy. The puppy which Mr. Hawkes gave
them takes up a deal of their time and Miss Tony
is busy collecting flowers for a prize which her
uncle has offered her. Master Cyril is not biting
his nails so much since I tried the bitter aloes.</p>

<p>I am sorry to have to incommode you, but I
wish to give a month’s notice, not through any
fault that I have to find with the place, which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>[230]</span>
has always been most comfortable and considerate,
but because Mr. Urible has now come back
from Mesopotamia and been demobbed and he
wants to be married at once. I should have preferred
to walk out a little longer, as I feel I should
like to know more of Bert now he has been in the
Army, as soldiers can be so different from greengrocers,
which is the way I used to know him before
the War, but he is very firm about it and I
don’t feel that I have the right, after being engaged
so long, to refuse. That is why dear Madam
I have to give notice and not through any
complaint or dissatisfaction.</p>

<p>I am very sorry for it, because I am very fond
of the children and I know that it is difficult to
find nursemaids now, but Mr. Urible is so firm
that I can’t do anything else. I think you would
like to know that he has grown much broader
while in the Army and is a far finer figure of a
man than he was when he joined up. He has
two medals.—I am, with respect, your faithful
servant,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Emily</span>,—Your letter came as a surprise:
not because I was not expecting you some day to
marry, but because I was trusting to you to keep
everything at Combehurst going until Miss Raby
was well enough to spare me. Believe me that
I am very glad that you have Urible safely back
again, but without wanting for a moment to interfere
with your plans I do most earnestly wish
that you could postpone your wedding for a few
weeks. Having waited so long would not Urible—and
you—be willing to wait a little longer?
Would not you? You have been such a comfort
to us for so long, being so trustworthy and understanding,
that I am distracted when I think of
finding anyone else, especially in these times.
Miss Raby still needs me constantly and I cannot
bear to abandon her now. May I think of you
as being prepared to stay another three months?—I
am, yours sincerely,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Madam</span>,—I have read your letter several
times and I have shown it to Mr. Urible. We
both feel the same about it; we feel that we have
waited long enough, especially Bert with all the
dreadful things in Mesopotamia to put up with,
the thermometer sometimes being over 120 and
sometimes below freezing in a few hours. But
we want to do what is right and what Mr. Urible
suggests with his respects to you Madam is that
we should be married as soon as possible, as arranged,
but that, until you come back in three
months or before, I should continue to be the children’s
nurse by day. Mr. Urible is taking over
Parsons’s shop and garden in the village and we
should live there. There are three nice rooms and
a good kitchen and scullery, and no doubt a neighbour
will cook Bert’s meals for him. Dear Madam
we are very wishful to oblige you but Mr.
Urible feels that after all he has been through in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233"></a>[233]</span>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Madam, Mrs. Rossiter</span>,—Pray excuse
me writing but I wish you to understand my position
with regard to Miss Goodyer, who has been
a good nurse to your children. It is not as selfish
as you think. Miss Goodyer and I were to have
married four years ago but then came the conscription
and it was impossible. While I was
away she promised to marry me directly there
was Peace, but I couldn’t get demobbed till a little
while ago, which means further delay, and
now she says that you have asked her to put me
off again. Pray pardon me, dear madam, but I
don’t think this is fair of you, or that it shows the
right feeling for a soldier who comes out of the
War a good deal worse off than he went in. While
I have been away fighting for my country my
business has gone to other people and now I am
asked to wait longer for my wife. Pardon me,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234"></a>[234]</span>
madam, but I don’t think it is fair. A man has
his feelings and rights.</p>

that kind of arrangement very much; a nurse with

however, the children might need things in the

at once. You are always so clever. I wrote to

<p>O foolish virgin, how little you know of men,
or at any rate of Fred! Once he is asleep no
noise in this world can wake him, and as for getting
things, he can get nothing. He is a pet, but
no one ever took such advantage of that aloofness<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237"></a>[237]</span>
from domestic co-operation which so many
men consider their right. In his attitude to the
children he is a mixture of a connoisseur and a
comedian. He is either admiring them—against
backgrounds, æsthetically, as though they were
porcelain or almond blossom, or physically, as
though they were prize puppies—or he is using
them as foils for his jokes. It is all very delightful
and we are a happy family, but it makes me
smile when you suggest that he could take the
place of Emily in any capacity whatever. Children,
he thinks, should be both seen and heard,
which shows that he is a modern enough parent,
but they should be seen only when they are picturesque
and heard only when they are gay. This
being so, please go on trying to find a nurse.
There is always one leaving. Every day hundreds
of children must grow out of nurses.—Yours,</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">My Dear</span>, I have no posthumous activities to
recommend to-day, having just returned from a
temple consecrated to youth, where, but for its
antiquity and its Roll of Honour, no one would
think of death. I mean Winchester.</p>

<p>My sister’s boy is there and I went down for
the day to see him: a nice candid jolly boy.</p>

<p>I came to the conclusion that there is a charm
about an old public school greater than that of
a university. The boy is more engaging than the
youth: he may have “side” and affectation among
his contemporaries, but with a much older man
such as I am he is himself in a way that the undergraduate
seldom is. The undergraduate’s whole
desire is so often to be taken for a man, whereas
the schoolboy at most would like to approximate
to an undergraduate.</p>

<p>Of all the schools that I know none is so attractive
as this. Its age, its traditions, its beauty,
alone would single it out: but I am taken with its
spirit too. When I go to see Dick I naturally<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240"></a>[240]</span>
meet many of his school-fellows; and I find a candour
and friendliness which is a strange contrast
to the social reserves of boys from other schools
I could name. I don’t know whether the whole
school is similarly fortunate, but in Dick’s house
there is a door-opening, door-closing and passing-the-salt
tendency which I fancy is often bad form
elsewhere. To talk with the immature man is
never easy, wherever you find him, and my inclination
would always be to jump the gulf that is
fixed between real childhood and real manhood;
but Dick’s companions are easier.</p>

<p>Nephews and uncles go through strange vicissitudes.
At first the uncle is an imposing creature
who appears but rarely and when he does must
be treated with respect and called Uncle on every
occasion. And then as the boy grows older and
understands the powers and possibilities of half-crowns
the uncle takes on a god-like mien. And
then, older still, he meets him on more equal
terms; which get more and more equal until the
time comes when he discovers that this once remarkable
person is nothing but a fogey and a
bore. Some uncles, before this last stage is
reached, attach themselves to their nephews as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241"></a>[241]</span>
satellites or boon companions and vie with them
in youthfulness, but I am not likely ever to do
that.</p>

<p>The relations of son and father have somewhat
similar stages, but there is as a rule too close a
tie there to permit of the half-contemptuous easy
terms on which nephew and uncle often rub along.
Dick is a good boy and should do well. I watched
him this afternoon longing to hit out but knowing
that the game demanded self-repression, and admired
him and saw earnest of sound citizenship
in it.</p>

<p>The next thing is to make sure he gets into
my dear Bannister’s College at Cambridge.</p>

<p>But, Verena, how glorious to be a boy! And
yet how comforting, now and then, to be old
enough to be useful to the young—when they
will let us!—Good night,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Nesta</span>,—I have had a brain-wave.
Why should not I go down to Combehurst until
you are free again and sleep near the children
and let Emily go on attending to them by day,
as she suggests, and keep an eye on her? I am
willing to. This would also liberate Fred for his
Dormy House, whither he could lug his clubs with
a clear conscience. If you accept this offer, don’t
overwhelm me with gratitude, because I shall be
pleasing myself more than anything else, this
abode being at the moment a most suitable one
to leave.</p>

<p>Father’s sarcasms have had very high velocity
of late. He said this morning, for example,
apropos of a very harmless young man who
brought me back from the theatre and whom I
was foolish enough to ask in for a whisky and
soda, that if girls looked at men with the eyes of
men the world would come to an end, because
there would be no marriages. I replied that I
supposed the effect would not be far different if<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243"></a>[243]</span>
men looked at women with the eyes of women;
which he would of course have himself included if
he was not eager to score off me. Not that this
young man had any more designs on me than the
rest of his sex. (I don’t count Horace.) Never
was a girl so unembarrassed by suitors as I or
more willing to be so. But it is part of father’s
humour to pretend that I hunt them and that I
catch only the most detrimental. How he would
behave if I really got engaged I often wonder.
Probably he would play the game.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Sister</span>,—It is seldom enough that
we hear from you direct, but news gets into circulation
in very curious ways and it was the oddest
chance which informed me that you may be
losing the services of Nesta as a companion during
your very regrettable indisposition. Letitia is so
much stronger than she was, thanks to the nourishing
delicacies which the strictest economy in
my own personal needs has made it possible for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247"></a>[247]</span>
me to obtain for her, that she is now perfectly
fitted to be at your side—where, being your sister,
she ought to be—and I hereby offer our services.
I say “our” for she would not care to come
alone, and I could, I am convinced, be useful and
stimulating in very many ways. I am not surprised
that Nesta should be leaving you. If the
stories that I hear of the wildness of those unmothered
children of hers are true, it is more than
time that she returned to her home. A mother’s
first duty is to her brood. The ties uniting aunt
and niece are of, comparatively, negligible slenderness.
Where there is, as alas! in your case,
no husband, a sister has the first claim to nourish
and protect. Awaiting your reply,—I am, your

<p><span class="smcap">Darling Hazel, Old Thing</span>,—Wish me luck
because I am starting out on the biggest enterprise
of my life. What a pity we are not Roman
Catholics and then you could burn candles for me.
I am going down to Aunt Verena’s to propose to
Clemency Power, that divine Irish girl. I wrote
to her last night but I’m such a rotten letter-writer
that I’m going down to see her in person and
learn my fate. I even tried to get the letter back,
but postmen are so rottenly honest. I waited for
hours in the rain for the pillar-box to be emptied
and offered him two pounds and an old overcoat,
but all he did was to threaten to call a policeman.
If she accepts me I shall be the luckiest man on
earth and there’s nothing I shan’t be able to do.
You’ll see. But if she turns me down I don’t
know what will happen. I shall probably become
a film-actor in broken-hearted stories. Lots of
people have said I have the right kind of mobile
face for the movies, and really there’s nothing
<i>infra dig</i> in it. Clemency is two or three years<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249"></a>[249]</span>
older than I am, but I think that’s all to the good.
What I need is a steadying hand. You will adore
her.—Yours ever,</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Darling Old Thing</span>,—It is no good. I am
down and out. The whole thing has been a failure.
To begin with, I had a hell of a journey, full
of hopes and fears alternately. In the taxi at Paddington
I felt full of buck and then while waiting
for the train to start I knew I was a goner. At
Reading I began to have hopes again and at Swindon
I wasn’t worth two-pence-halfpenny. At
Newport I nearly got out and came back and at
Hereford I had a big whisky and soda and was
confident once more. But all the way from the
station to the house I just sweated.</p>

<p>The very first thing I saw as I came up the
drive was Clemency playing tennis with the new
Doctor, and my heart sank like a U boat into my
socks. I knew in my bones that everything was
up; and I was right. Whether or not Clemency
is booked, I don’t know, but she won’t have me.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250"></a>[250]</span>
She was as nice as she could be, and her voice
drove me frantic every time she spoke, but she
held out no hope. I expect the sawbones will get
her, he’s the kind of quiet, assured, efficient card
that a flighty blighter like me would never have a
chance against. And he’s nobbled the whole place.
Aunt Verena thinks he’s It.</p>

<p>I stuck it for two days and then I made an excuse
and came away. And now, what do you
think I’m doing? I’m a railway porter. I carry
people’s luggage at Paddington and tell them
when the train starts for Thingumbob—if ever it
does—and what time the train comes in from
Stick-in-the-mud. I was going to Ireland to fish
and try to forget—Clemency told me of a place
called Curragh Lake—but the strike came and put
the lid on that for the moment. The joke is that
the old ladies all want to know what lord I am—as
the papers have given them the idea that at
Paddington there are only noblemen helping.—Your
broken-hearted</p>

<span class="smcap">Richard Haven to Verena Raby</span></h2>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Verena</span>, I think that we may all
feel happier than we were doing. Even if Old
England stands not quite where she did, the bulldog
breed is not extinct. The way in which the
nation has taken the railway trouble, and the
lightning efficiency of the food distributing arrangements,
should put dismay into enemy hearts—and
under the word enemy I include Allies and
rivals—and renew our own individual and corporate
ambition and national spirit. In that way
the Strike may be said to have been a blessing in
disguise, although industrially it has been a calamity.
It may also make people look a little more
narrowly at their pence, which is what we shall
all have to do before long.</p>

<p>The oddest things happened, not the least of
which I heard of yesterday, when one of the few
K.C.’s whom it is my privilege to know showed me
on his watch chain the shilling which had been
given him, in his capacity as a porter at Victoria,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252"></a>[252]</span>
by his butcher, all unconscious of his identity, as
a tip for helping with the family luggage on their
return from the South Coast. The K.C. said
nothing at the time, except Thank you, but when
things are a little quieter he is going to show it to
his purveyor of indifferent Peace-time joints and
enjoy a good laugh with him.</p>

<p>I have been wondering if alms-houses for the
rich are not more important than for the poor.
On all sides I hear of old widowed ladies who,
needing homes, or companions, spend their time
in visiting one married daughter or married son
after another, when they would be far happier in
a little colony like Hampton Court. Couldn’t
you do something for them? But you would have
to be very careful. If any suspicion of charity
got about, the whole scheme would fail. So you
could not put them together, even in the most
exquisite little garden-village homes. They would
have to be isolated. At what point in the social
scale a necessitous old lady ceases to be willing
to have her necessity known, I cannot say; but
certainly those who suffer most from it would
least like it published.</p>

<p>Old gentlemen don’t mind becoming Brothers<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253"></a>[253]</span>
of the Charterhouse, but what about their Sisters?
I doubt it.</p>

<p>Only therefore by the exercise of great secrecy
could you benefit them.</p>

<p>And have you ever thought of the men who are
tossed up and down all day and all night on light-ships?
To keep others safe. What a life and
what opportunities to the philanthropist!</p>

<p>Here is the poem, which, I trust, is not too
sad:—</p>

<p>I had an unexpected and not too welcome visitor
yesterday in the somewhat Gothic shape of
Horace Mun-Brown, who had discovered from
Evangeline where I was. He stayed to lunch—<i>your</i>
food and drink—and talked exclusively of
himself and his creative brain, both of which he
again laid at my feet. I suppose some men like
the sensation of being turned down, but I feel
somehow that I should hate it. I mean as a habit—and
by the same person. Perhaps the shock
to Horace’s egoism is a kind of stimulant and he
goes off and is more creative than ever. At any
rate he went away with his absurd head high in
the air and what is called a confident tread, and
this morning came a long letter about his latest
scheme, which is to run a theatre called The Polyglot
for plays in foreign languages, in order to get
the patronage of the various foreign residents in
London. One week a Greek play, for the Greek
colony, then an Italian, for the Italian, then a
Russian, then an American, and so forth. But
he can carry this fatiguing project through successfully
only if he has my wifely co-operation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255"></a>[255]</span>
and, I suppose, the necessary capital. But it is the
wifely co-operation that he insists upon and that

<p>Now I am going to tell you the ghost story
that the distinguished Orientalist told Bemerton
and Bemerton told me. I shall tell it as though
I myself were the owner of the fatal jewel—for
that is the <i>motif</i>.</p>

<p>We begin with the Indian Mutiny, when a
British soldier broke into a temple and wrenched
the jewel from the forehead of a god. This jewel<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256"></a>[256]</span>
passed into the hands of my grandfather and then
my father and gradually reached me. It was of a
remarkable beauty—a huge ruby—but beyond
keeping it in a box in the dining-room and showing
it occasionally to guests, I gave little thought
to my new possession.</p>

<p>Neither my grandfather nor father had been too
prosperous, and from the moment the stone became
mine I began to experience reverses—not
very serious, but continuous. It was a long time
before I suspected any connection between these
little calamities and the jewel, but gradually I began
to do so. One evening I received a shock.
Several people were dining with me and suddenly
the servant put a piece of paper in my hand on
which one of the guests had written “Am I dreaming,
or is there really a Hindoo sitting on the
floor behind you? Nobody else seems to notice
him.” On my asking him about it afterwards he
said that the Hindoo was scrabbling on the ground
as though digging a hole with his nails and that
he had a very malignant expression. From time
to time two or three other people, all unaware of
the legend, wondered if there was not a figure of
this kind in the room, and I began to get nervous.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257"></a>[257]</span>
I told the story to a friend who knows more about
India than any one living. “I should get rid of
that stone,” he said. “It’s dangerous. But you
must be quit of it scientifically.”</p>

<p>I must take it, he told me, to one of the Thames
bridges and throw it into the river at dead low
tide.</p>

<p>With the assistance of the almanack we ascertained
the exact moment and I dropped it over.
Then I went home with a light heart.</p>

<p>Three months later a man called to see me.
He knew, he said, that I was interested in Oriental
curiosities and he had a very remarkable one
to show me. A ruby. It had been dredged up
from the Thames and he had heard of the workman
who had found it and had bought it and now
gave me the first offer. It was, of course, <i>the</i>
stone. Well, I recognize fate when I meet it, and
I bought it back. Kismet.</p>

<p>But although I was willing still to own it, if
such was the notion of destiny, I was against
keeping it at home any more. So I procured a
metal box and wrapped up the jewel and sealed
it and locked the box and sealed that and deposited
it at my Bank in the City, where it was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258"></a>[258]</span>
placed in one of the strong rooms. That was only
a little while ago.</p>

<p>Last week I had occasion to visit the bank to
consult the manager on some point of business.
After we had finished we chatted awhile. Looking
round at the girls at the desks—all called in
to take the place of the male clerks who had gone
to the War, and many of them kept on,—I asked
him how they compared in efficiency with the men.</p>

<p>He said that generally they were not so good.
They were not so steady and were liable to nerves
and fancies.</p>

<p>“For example,” he said, “it’s impossible to get
some of them to go to the strong room at all,
because they say there is a horrible little Hindoo
squatting there and scrabbling on the floor.”</p>

<p>There is no news and here is the poem. You
must recover very quickly now, under the Paragon’s
treatment, because the supply of verses is
running short:—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Verena</span>, one final word about your
money. I have, I think, a really good suggestion
at last; at any rate it is one which I myself, in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260"></a>[260]</span>
your position, should follow. Not only as a valuable
gift, but as a well merited stroke of criticism,
it would be a fine thing if you were to leave the
money to the Prime Minister of the day, not for
his own use but to increase the paltry £1200
which is all the money for new Civil List pensions
that this great nation can find every year.
Every year the number of claimants for its miserable
little doles is far in excess of those that
can be helped, and the help is therefore of the
most meagre, and often, I should guess, useless
kind. A pension of £50 a year to the widow of
this eminent but unfortunate man, £70 to the
daughter of that, and so forth—always “In consideration
of his distinguished services to Science,
Literature, Art or to his country” and of “the
necessitous circumstances” of those whom he has
left behind. If some of these fifties could be
turned into hundreds it would be an act of benevolence
indeed. What do you say? Alms-houses
are excellent, but somehow I feel that this is
better.</p>

<p>Little Mrs. Peters amused me yesterday with
one of her remarks. Speaking of the impending
visit of her sister-in-law, she said, “I want to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261"></a>[261]</span>
give her a decent lunch but I don’t want to appear
well off. Don’t you think an old partridge
stewed is the thing?”</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Dearest Richard</span>,—Forgive me for not answering
sooner, but serious things have been happening.</p>

<p>I am entirely with you about the Civil List.
I cannot believe that the superfluity of the estate
could be devoted to any better purpose and I
am arranging it at once. But there is not the
urgency that there was, because <i>I’m going to get
better</i>. Mr. Field found something pressing somewhere
and removed it and I am already able to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262"></a>[262]</span>
stand. Think of that! He says that all I need
now is to get some bracing change of air and lose
the weakness that comes of lying down so long.
And to think that once I was grumbling to you
about his coming here at all! We never recognise,
until after, the messengers of the friendly
gods. It is really a kind of miracle and I’m so
sorry about dear old Dr. Ferguson, who was always,
although the kindest thing on earth, a little
gloomy and pessimistic about me, and who will,
although pleased—because his heart is gold—be
also a little displeased, by the younger man’s
triumph—because his heart is human as well.
That is all, to-day, but when I tell you that I am
writing this at my desk in my bedroom—the first
letter to any one under such novel and wonderful
conditions—you have got to be very happy and
drink my health. And now I half want not to get
well because I shall miss all my kind friends’
kindnesses and solicitous little acts.—Your very
grateful</p>

<p><i>P.S.</i>—You must not any longer be at the pains
of writing to me so often, and I cannot allow
you to be at the expense of Clemency any more.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263"></a>[263]</span>
I am now (alas!) independent of all these kind
amenities; and my dear Nesta goes home to-morrow.
I have kept her too long from her home.
I shall feel lost indeed, and am wondering if
health is worth such a breakup.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My Dear</span>, the news is terrific and I sent you
a telegram at once. I am rejoiced, and yet—what
is to become of me now? I had formed habits
of talking to you every day which I greatly prized
and now they are to be broken. The young doctor
is certainly a gift from heaven and I should
like his permanent address. As to Miss Power,
I have not any intention of giving her the sack<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264"></a>[264]</span>
but if she sends in her resignation I must accept
it. I think, however, that you make a mistake in
demobilizing the staff so rapidly. These things
are best done by gradations and I, for one, intend
to remain on duty for some little while yet. I
hear so many things that have only half their
flavour until they are passed on to you. You will
therefore oblige me by issuing a reprieve in so
far as my poor pen is concerned and allow it to
continue in your service. The moral seems to
be: When one is really ill, present one’s regular
doctor with a fishing rod.—Yours ever,</p>

heavenly to have her here again. I am so glad
you are getting well. Hazel is going to stay

a croquet mallet balanced on his forehead. He
is very nice. He calls us his pupils and we are

brings vegetables. Hazel’s friend sings too and
Hazel plays for him and we all dance. He is
teaching us the Highland fling. He says I have
light fantastic toes. Hazel is teaching him hesitation
which he never knew before. Mother is
fatter. She says it is because she has not had us
to worry her, but as she has had Lobbie it must
be your nice things to eat. It is lovely and enchanting

<span class="smcap">Horace Mun-Brown to Verena Raby</span></h2>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Aunt</span>,—The news of Hazel’s engagement
has prostrated me and also filled me with a
kind of despair about life in general. That a
lawn-tennis player should, for a permanency, be
preferred to a man of ideas is so essentially wrong
that one is left gasping. Lawn-tennis is a frivolous
capering game for a few fine days in summer<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272"></a>[272]</span>
and then not again till next year, while ideas
go on for ever.</p>

<p>Now that you are so much better again, you
will probably be intent upon spending your superfluity
in your own way, but I want you to listen
to one more project of mine. It will show you too
how my mind has been working. You know the
old joke about men going out fishing or shooting
and expecting to bring trout or game back to their
wives, but, through want of sport, having to stop
at the fishmonger’s or poulterer’s on their way
home? Well, it suddenly occurred to me while
I was shaving yesterday that here is the germ of
a very successful business. You know how every
traveller promises his family or his friends that
he will bring back something. If he is going to
the East, he generally promises a parrot or a shawl
or a string of amber beads. If he is going to
Africa, he promises, say, ostrich feathers or assegais.
But in any case he promises something
and—this is the point—probably forgets, and
therefore comes back empty-handed and is in consequence
despised. Now, my idea is that great
emporiums should be stocked and opened somewhere
near the points of disembarkation from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273"></a>[273]</span>
abroad. The ships from foreign parts disgorge
their passengers at Liverpool or Southampton or
London, and I should establish a great bazaar
close to the harbour at each spot where everything
that had been promised and forgotten could
be purchased—parrots, shawls, beads, ostrich
feathers, assegais, everything. The returning
traveller would see it, his face would brighten,
he would dash in and buy and be no longer
ashamed or afraid to meet his wife. Don’t you
think that a good notion?</p>

<p>All that is needed is a clever fellow—an ex-P.
&amp; O. officer, say, who knows the world and
travellers’ ways—to be put in control, and enough
capital to give the show a real start, and the result
would be easy. Would you not care to invest?—I
am, yours sincerely,</p>

<p>Blow the cymbals, bang the fife, I’m so bucked
I don’t know what to do. I’m engaged to the
sweetest creature you ever saw or dreamed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274"></a>[274]</span>
of—Clemency’s sister Pat. You see, Clemency gave
me a letter of introduction to her people, and the
fish took such a dislike to me that one day I got
a car and went over to see them. They’ve got a
jolly place not far from Kenmare—the post office
is at Sneem—and the old lady, who’s not old at
all and no end of a sport, and her two other
daughters, Patricia and Adela, live there, all
among little cows and chickens and bamboos and
tropical plants. You see, the Gulf Stream comes
in here and makes delicate things grow like the
very devil. Clemency is a peach, but you should
see Pat, and, even more, you should hear her!
Clemency’s voice laid me out flat enough, but
Pat’s is even more disastrous, begorra! You
should hear her say “I will” where you and I and
other dull English people would say “Yes,” or “I
will not” when we should say “No,” or “I won’t.”
The word “will” as she says it is like something
on a lovely flute. She’s younger than I am too.
I think a husband should be older than his wife.
Clemency was just the other side, you know.
Anyway, she has said “I will” to me, and the old
lady is agreeable provided I can show some signs
of responsibility and so I am bucketing back on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275"></a>[275]</span>
Sunday to begin work in earnest and be worthy of
her.</p>

<p>It’s wonderful how everything works out for
you when you let it. I go cold when I think of
how awful it would be to marry Clemency and
then meet this angel-pet. I should probably have
seen her first as a bridesmaid, and then—but it
won’t bear thinking about. The Fates sent Field
down to Kington just in time. I am coming back
next week to go seriously into this motor transport
affair that Aunt Verena is helping to finance for
me, and as soon as it gets started I’ll begin to arrange
to marry. No man is worth a damn till he’s
married. With Pat to help I could do what that
old Greek johnny was going to do with a fulcrum
or something—move the earth. Cheerio!—Yours,</p>

so little else to do and believing that life
was over—you must not re-enter my heart. It is
sealed against you—at least so long as you keep
away. How I should feel if I saw you, I cannot

You were to have given me so much; you took so

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Verena</span>,—Your letter of good news to
my poor Letitia has made us extravagantly happy—or
at least it would have done so had any form
of extravagance not become impossible. I am
not in the habit of criticising those in authority;
I think it a bad habit to which the facile grumblers,
who form a large majority in this country
generally, and particularly in towns such as this,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278"></a>[278]</span>
where most of the residents live on pensions or
fixed incomes, are too prone. None the less, I
cannot conceal my chagrin and surprise that the
Government cannot do more towards lowering the
cost of living. Our weekly bills become more
formidable every week, without any apparent reason.
Why, for example, should a remote war in
Europe increase the price of butter and eggs? The
cows were not belligerents; there were no casualties
in the poultry yards. As for coal, I am in
despair, and the thought that your poor sister
may be without the comfort of fires this winter
fills me with a profound melancholy.</p>

<p>I wonder if you could get your friend Mr.
Haven to help me to some task. I know him to
be an influential person and I know myself to
be capable. Although over age—not in fact but
through a ridiculous rule of the Civil Service—and
therefore disqualified to continue my labours
for my country, I am still sound in mind and
body. Indeed my intellect was never brighter,
as many of my Tunbridge Wells friends with
whom I am in the habit of discussing public
affairs every day, would, I flatter myself, assure
you. There is I believe a new public functionary<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279"></a>[279]</span>
called a Censor of Films. I feel that I could
be very useful in such a capacity, if what is needed
is a man of all-round sagacity and some imagination.
But I would leave the nature of the post
to your friend.</p>

<p>Such a task might bring in enough extra revenue
to make all the difference to poor Letitia’s life.</p>

<p>Meanwhile I rejoice in your recovery, trusting
fervently that there is nothing illusory about it.
Unhappily I have known cases of spinal trouble
improving only to return with more severity; but
I intend to fight against harbouring such fears for
you. Letitia would send her love but she is engaged
at the moment in making a fair copy of
an address which I am to deliver at our Social
Circle on the credibility of present evidence on
the persistence of our daily life’s routine after
death. It is a labour of love to her, which is
fortunate as I cannot afford an amanuensis.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Aunt</span>,—I am deeply gratified to hear
that your recovery is complete and that you have
all your old and beneficial activity again.</p>

<p>After so long and costly an illness I am sure
that, wealthy as you are, you would not, in these
very expensive times, wish to lose any opportunity
of adding to your fortune; and such an
opportunity now occurs. You have heard of
the paper shortage? Owing to the war only a
small proportion of the paper needed for journals
and magazines and books is now being made. The
problem then is, how to supply the deficiency?
And it is here that my scheme comes in.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281"></a>[281]</span></p>

<p>If new paper cannot be manufactured from
wood pulp—owing to the scarcity of labour in
the forests—it must be made in other ways. Now
the best of these is from old paper. Now this
can be done satisfactorily only if the printed
words on it can be removed; in other words (to
be for a moment scientific) it must be “de-inked.”
De-inking is a mysterious business, but Sybil,
who took a course of chemistry at Newnham, has
hit on a process which cannot fail. She has tried
it in the kitchen of her flat with an old copy of
the <i>Nineteenth Century and After</i> and found it
perfect. Our plan then is to buy up thousands
and thousands of the largest papers, such as the
<i>Daily Telegraph</i> and the <i>Queen</i> and the <i>Field</i>—the
paper for each copy of which now probably
costs more than the price it is sold for (this discrepancy
being made possible by the wealth of
advertisements)—de-ink them and sell the new
paper at a considerable profit. All that is needed
is the capital for the erection of the de-inking
plant. Speed is of course imperative. If you
are interested—and this cannot fail—please telegraph.</p>

<p>Ever since the day when I first met Sybil in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282"></a>[282]</span>
Egyptian Room at the British Museum my life
has been a whirl of joy and intellectual stimulus.
We are both convinced that we lived and loved
before, in a previous existence, and Sybil even
goes so far as to believe that as ancient Egyptians
we were instrumental in overcoming a papyrus
shortage in the days of the Ptolemies. Personally
I think this a little fanciful, but it might be true.
Who can say? And women have wonderful intuition.</p>

<p>We both long to be united. Lack of pence is
our only obstacle.</p>

This and all associated files of various formats will be found in:

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you will have to check the laws of the country where
  you are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
